## 1. Combat System Architecture

### 1.1 Class Hierarchies and Inheritance Patterns

**Unified Base Classes:**
- **`Weapon` (Abstract Base Class)**: Provides common properties for all weapons
  - `name`, `damage`, `soundFile`, `weaponLength`, `weaponAccuracy`, `weaponType`
  - `states`, `initialStateName`, `projectileName`
  - **Location**: `/src/main/java/combat/Weapon.java`

- **`RangedWeapon extends Weapon`**: Adds ranged-specific properties
  - `velocityFeetPerSecond`, `ammunition`, `maximumRange`, `firingModes`
  - **Location**: `/src/main/java/combat/RangedWeapon.java`

- **`MeleeWeapon extends Weapon`**: Adds melee-specific properties
  - `meleeType`, `defendScore`, `attackSpeed`, `attackCooldown`, `weaponRange`
  - **Location**: `/src/main/java/combat/MeleeWeapon.java`

**Combat Resolution Unified Through:**
- **`CombatResolver`**: Single class handling both ranged and melee combat resolution
- **`HitResult`**: Common structure for both combat types
- **`Character`**: Dual weapon system with both `rangedWeapon` and `meleeWeapon` properties

### 1.2 State Management Differences

**Ranged Weapon States:**
```
holstered → drawing → ready → aiming → firing → recovering → [reload if needed]
slung → unsling → ready → aiming → firing → recovering
```

**Melee Weapon States:**
```
sheathed → unsheathing → melee_ready → melee_attacking → [recovery to melee_ready]
switching_to_melee → melee_ready → melee_attacking
```

**Key Architectural Insight:** Both systems use the same `WeaponState` class and state transition mechanisms, but with different state names and timing characteristics. This enables code reuse while maintaining distinct combat flows.

### 1.3 Event Scheduling and Timing Mechanisms

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Both systems use unified `PriorityQueue<ScheduledEvent>` for timing
- 60 FPS tick-based timing system (60 ticks = 1 second)
- Same event ownership and cancellation mechanisms

**Ranged Combat Timing:**
- **Projectile Travel Time**: `Math.round(distanceFeet / velocityFeetPerSecond * 60)` ticks
- **Aiming Speed Modifiers**: Careful (2.0x slower), Normal (1.0x), Quick (0.5x faster)
- **Automatic Firing**: Burst and full-auto modes with cyclic rate timing
- **Ammunition Management**: Reload sequences with different timing per weapon

**Melee Combat Timing:**
- **No Travel Time**: Immediate impact resolution upon attack execution
- **Attack Speed**: Weapon-specific `attackSpeed` property (e.g., 90-150 ticks)
- **Attack Cooldown**: Recovery time before next attack (e.g., 90-150 ticks)
- **Movement-Based**: Time spent moving to engage target

### 1.4 Integration with Main Game Loop

**Unified Update Cycle** (Location: `/src/main/java/OpenFields2.java:222`):
```java
for (Unit u : units) {
    u.update(gameClock.getCurrentTick());
    // Update automatic targeting for both ranged and melee
    u.character.updateAutomaticTargeting(u, gameClock.getCurrentTick(), eventQueue, this);
    // Update melee movement progress and trigger attacks when in range
    u.character.updateMeleeMovement(u, gameClock.getCurrentTick(), eventQueue, this);
}
```

## 2. Weapon Systems Comparison

### 2.1 Weapon Data Structures and Properties

**Common Properties (Weapon base class):**
- **Basic Info**: `name`, `damage`, `soundFile`, `weaponLength`, `weaponAccuracy`
- **System Integration**: `weaponType`, `states`, `initialStateName`, `projectileName`

**Ranged-Specific Properties:**
- **Ballistics**: `velocityFeetPerSecond`, `maximumRange`
- **Ammunition**: `ammunition`, `maxAmmunition`, `reloadTicks`
- **Rate of Fire**: `firingDelay`, `cyclicRate`, `burstSize`
- **Modes**: `currentFiringMode`, `availableFiringModes` (single/burst/auto)

**Melee-Specific Properties:**
- **Combat Mechanics**: `meleeType`, `defendScore`, `attackSpeed`, `attackCooldown`
- **Physical Properties**: `weaponRange` (reach), `readyingTime`
- **Characteristics**: `isOneHanded`, `isMeleeVersionOfRanged` (e.g., bayonet)

### 2.2 JSON Configuration Differences

**Ranged Weapon JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "Colt Peacemaker",
  "velocity": 800,
  "damage": 25,
  "maxAmmunition": 6,
  "reloadTicks": 180,
  "reloadType": "SINGLE_ROUND",
  "maximumRange": 100,
  "weaponAccuracy": 45,
  "firingDelay": 120,
  "cyclicRate": 60,
  "burstSize": 3,
  "availableFiringModes": ["SINGLE_SHOT"],
  "projectileName": "9mm round"
}
```

**Melee Weapon JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "Steel Dagger",
  "damage": 6,
  "meleeType": "SHORT",
  "defendScore": 40,
  "attackSpeed": 60,
  "attackCooldown": 60,
  "weaponLength": 1.5,
  "readyingTime": 45,
  "isOneHanded": true,
  "weaponAccuracy": 15,
  "projectileName": "dagger strike"
}
```

### 2.3 Factory Patterns and Weapon Creation

**Unified Factory Approach:**
- `WeaponFactory.createWeapon(String weaponId)` → Returns `RangedWeapon`
- `MeleeWeaponFactory.createWeapon(String meleeWeaponId)` → Returns `MeleeWeapon`
- Both factories load from JSON via `DataManager`
- Both automatically configure weapon states from `WeaponTypeData`

**Key Difference - Weapon Type Mapping:**
- **Ranged**: `WeaponType.PISTOL`, `WeaponType.RIFLE`, `WeaponType.OTHER`
- **Melee**: `WeaponType.MELEE_UNARMED`, `WeaponType.MELEE_SHORT`, `WeaponType.MELEE_MEDIUM`, `WeaponType.MELEE_LONG`

### 2.4 Weapon Switching and Mode Management

**Combat Mode Toggle** (Location: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java:299`):
```java
public void toggleCombatMode() {
    // Cancel ongoing attacks and movement
    if (isMovingToMelee) { /* cancel melee movement */ }
    if (isAttacking) { /* cancel ongoing attack */ }
    
    isMeleeCombatMode = !isMeleeCombatMode;
    
    // Initialize weapon state for new mode
    if (isMeleeCombatMode && meleeWeapon != null) {
        currentWeaponState = meleeWeapon.getInitialState();
    }
}
```

## 3. Combat Mechanics Analysis

### 3.1 Hit Calculation Algorithms and Modifiers

**Ranged Combat Hit Calculation** (Location: `/src/main/java/CombatCalculator.java:26`):
```java
double chanceToHit = 50.0 + 
    statToModifier(shooter.character.dexterity) + 
    stressModifier + 
    rangeModifier + 
    weaponModifier + 
    movementModifier + 
    aimingSpeedModifier + 
    targetMovementModifier + 
    woundModifier + 
    skillModifier;
```

**Melee Combat Hit Calculation** (Location: `/src/main/java/CombatResolver.java:456`):
```java
int hitChance = 60 + // Base 60% vs 50% for ranged
    attackerDexterity + 
    weaponAccuracy + 
    skillBonus - 
    movementPenalty - 
    targetDefense; // Active defense vs passive targeting
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Base Hit Chance**: Melee 60% vs Ranged 50%
- **Range Factor**: Ranged has complex range modifiers; melee has binary in-range/out-of-range
- **Target Defense**: Melee includes active target dexterity defense; ranged uses movement-based evasion
- **Complexity**: Ranged uses 11+ modifiers; melee uses 6 modifiers

### 3.2 Damage Calculation Formulas

**Unified Damage Scaling:**
Both systems use the same wound severity scaling via `CombatCalculator.calculateActualDamage()`:
- **CRITICAL/SERIOUS**: Full weapon damage
- **LIGHT**: 40% of weapon damage (minimum 1)
- **SCRATCH**: Fixed 1 damage

**Melee Enhancement** (Location: `/src/main/java/CombatResolver.java:386`):
```java
int strengthModifier = getStatModifier(attacker.character.strength);
int actualDamage = Math.max(1, scaledDamage + strengthModifier);
```
Melee adds strength modifier (+/-20 range) to scaled damage, while ranged uses base weapon damage only.

**Headshot Multiplier:**
Both systems apply 1.5x damage multiplier for head hits.

### 3.3 Range and Distance Handling

**Ranged Combat Range System:**
- **Maximum Range**: Weapon-specific (e.g., 100 feet for pistol, 300 feet for rifle)
- **Optimal Range**: 30% of maximum range (10-foot bonus at point-blank)
- **Range Modifier**: Smooth degradation from +10 at optimal to -20 at maximum
- **Targeting**: Line-of-sight with perpendicular velocity calculations

**Melee Combat Range System:**
- **Total Reach**: `4.0 feet (base engagement) + weaponLength`
- **Edge-to-Edge**: Subtracts 1.5-foot character radius from center-to-center distance
- **Binary System**: Either in-range (can attack) or out-of-range (must move)

**Range Examples:**
- **Unarmed**: 4.5 feet total reach
- **Dagger**: 5.5 feet total reach  
- **Sword**: 7.5 feet total reach
- **Spear**: 9.5 feet total reach

### 3.4 Movement Integration Requirements

**Ranged Combat Movement:**
- **Shooting While Moving**: Penalties applied to accuracy (-5 to -25 modifier)
- **Target Movement**: Perpendicular velocity calculations affect hit chance
- **Position Independent**: Can shoot from any position with appropriate penalties

**Melee Combat Movement:**
- **Movement to Engage**: Automatic pathfinding to reach melee range
- **Pursuit Mechanics**: Continuous target tracking with 50-foot maximum pursuit
- **Movement Cancellation**: Mode switching cancels ongoing melee movement
- **Position Critical**: Must be within weapon reach to attack

## 4. Attack Execution Workflows

### 4.1 Manual Attack Initiation (Right-Click Behavior)

**Unified Input Processing** (Location: `/src/main/java/InputManager.java:422`):
```java
// Check if unit is in melee combat mode
if (unit.character.isMeleeCombatMode() && unit.character.meleeWeapon != null) {
    // Handle melee attack
    debugPrint("[ATTACK-DECISION] Routing to MELEE attack");
    startMeleeAttackSequence(unit, clickedUnit);
} else {
    // Handle ranged attack (existing logic)
    debugPrint("[ATTACK-DECISION] Routing to RANGED attack");
    unit.character.startAttackSequence(/* ... */);
}
```

**Ranged Attack Flow:**
1. Check weapon state and ammunition
2. Calculate time to fire from current state
3. Schedule state transitions (draw → ready → aim → fire)
4. Apply aiming speed modifiers
5. Schedule projectile impact with travel time

**Melee Attack Flow:**
1. Check if target is in melee range
2. If out of range: initiate movement to target
3. If in range: schedule weapon state transitions (unsheath → ready → attack)
4. Apply attack speed modifiers
5. Schedule immediate impact (no travel time)

### 4.2 Automatic Targeting Integration

**Unified Automatic Targeting System** (Location: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java:1697`):
```java
if (isMeleeCombatMode() && meleeWeapon != null) {
    // Check if already in melee range
    if (distance <= meleeRangePixels) {
        startMeleeAttackSequence(/* ... */);
    } else {
        // Set up melee movement tracking
        isMovingToMelee = true;
        meleeTarget = newTarget;
    }
} else {
    startAttackSequence(/* ... */); // Ranged attack
}
```

### 4.3 Event Scheduling and Timing

**Ranged Combat Event Chain:**
```
scheduleFiring() → scheduleProjectileImpact() → resolveCombatImpact()
```
- Events span multiple seconds due to projectile travel time
- Complex state management for burst/auto firing modes

**Melee Combat Event Chain:**
```
scheduleMeleeAttack() → scheduleMeleeImpact() → resolveCombatImpact()
```
- Immediate impact resolution
- Simpler state management focused on attack/recovery cycles

### 4.4 Combat Resolution Processes

**Unified Resolution Through CombatResolver** (Location: `/src/main/java/CombatResolver.java:34`):
```java
if (weapon instanceof MeleeWeapon) {
    combatMessage = ">>> " + weapon.getName() + " strikes " + target + "...";
} else {
    combatMessage = ">>> " + weapon.getProjectileName() + " hit " + target + "...";
}
```
