This analysis identifies potentially unused methods in `InputManager.java` based on IntelliJ IDE warnings and code review. The InputManager class has undergone extensive refactoring through multiple DevCycles (15c through 15k), with many methods moved to dedicated component classes, leaving behind unused delegation methods and obsolete helper functions.

**File Statistics:**
- **Total Lines**: 1,775
- **Public Methods**: 21 identified
- **Private Methods**: 44 identified
- **Refactoring History**: Extensive (DevCycle 15c-15k component extraction)

## Analysis Methodology

1. **IDE Warnings**: IntelliJ reports many methods as unused
2. **Code Review**: Manual inspection of method calls and references
3. **Refactoring History**: Analysis of DevCycle comments indicating moved functionality
4. **Delegation Pattern**: Identification of methods that only delegate to other components

## Unused Methods by Priority

### ðŸ”´ Priority 1: Highly Likely Unused (Immediate Removal Candidates)

#### 1. `legacyValidateComponentIntegrity()` - Line 419
```java
private boolean legacyValidateComponentIntegrity()
```
**Status**: Almost certainly unused
**Reason**: 
- Explicitly marked as "for backward compatibility"
- Only calls `inputDiagnosticService` methods
- No external references found
**Risk**: Very Low - marked as legacy

#### 2. `handleScenarioNameInput()` - Line 1101
```java
private void handleScenarioNameInput()
```
**Status**: Unused delegation wrapper
**Reason**: 
- Only calls `gameStateManager.handleScenarioNameInput()`
- No additional logic
- Simplified to delegation only per DevCycle 15j comment
**Risk**: Low - pure delegation

#### 3. `promptForThemeSelection()` - Line 1108
```java
private void promptForThemeSelection()
```
**Status**: Incorrectly implemented
**Reason**: 
- Calls `gameStateManager.handleScenarioNameInput()` (wrong method?)
- Comment says "Simplified to delegation" but implementation appears wrong
- No actual theme selection logic
**Risk**: Low - appears broken anyway

#### 4. `getThemeDisplayName(String themeId)` - Line 1178
```java
private String getThemeDisplayName(String themeId)
```
**Status**: Orphaned helper method
**Reason**: 
- Private utility method with hardcoded theme mappings
- Likely unused after refactoring to other components
- Simple switch statement that could be elsewhere
**Risk**: Low - pure utility function

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2: Potentially Unused (Requires Verification)

#### 5. `displayEnhancedCharacterStats(Unit unit)` - Line 1241
```java
private void displayEnhancedCharacterStats(Unit unit)
```
**Status**: Potentially unused
**Reason**: 
- Complex private method for character display
- May have been replaced by DisplayCoordinator functionality
- Contains detailed character information formatting
**Risk**: Medium - complex logic that might still be needed

#### 6. `displayMultiCharacterSelection()` - Line 1278
```java
private void displayMultiCharacterSelection()
```
**Status**: Potentially unused
**Reason**: 
- Simple helper for multi-selection display
- May be replaced by SelectionManager or DisplayCoordinator
- Only formats selection output
**Risk**: Low - simple formatting function

#### 7. `getFactionDisplayName(int faction)` - Line 1294
```java
private String getFactionDisplayName(int faction)
```
**Status**: Potentially replaced
**Reason**: 
- Returns hardcoded faction names (Red, Blue, Green, etc.)
- May be replaced by FactionRegistry or InputUtils
- Simple lookup function
**Risk**: Low - easily replaceable

#### 8. `generateRandomCharacterForFaction(int faction)` - Line 1657
```java
private combat.Character generateRandomCharacterForFaction(int faction)
```
**Status**: Potentially unused
**Reason**: 
- Complex character generation with hardcoded names/stats
- May be replaced by CharacterFactory functionality
- Contains significant business logic
**Risk**: High - complex functionality, verify before removal

### ðŸŸ  Priority 3: Delegation Methods (Refactoring Opportunities)

#### 9. `handleEditModeKeys(KeyEvent e)` - Line 536
```java
private void handleEditModeKeys(KeyEvent e)
```
**Status**: Delegation wrapper
**Reason**: 
- Mostly delegates to `editModeManager.handleEditModeKeys(e)`
- Contains some direct logic for Ctrl+Shift+V and Ctrl+Shift+N
- Mixed delegation pattern
**Risk**: Medium - contains some direct logic

#### 10. `handleSaveLoadControls(KeyEvent e)` - Line 748
```java
private void handleSaveLoadControls(KeyEvent e)
```
**Status**: Pure delegation
**Reason**: 
- Only calls `gameStateManager.handleSaveLoadControls(e)`
- No additional logic
**Risk**: Low - pure delegation

#### 11. `promptForCharacterDeployment()` - Line 837
```java
private void promptForCharacterDeployment()
```
**Status**: Pure delegation
**Reason**: 
- Only calls `deploymentController.promptForCharacterDeployment()`
- DevCycle 15h comment indicates delegation
**Risk**: Low - pure delegation

#### 12. `cancelCharacterDeployment()` - Line 859
```java
private void cancelCharacterDeployment()
```
**Status**: Pure delegation
**Reason**: 
- Only calls `deploymentController.cancelCharacterDeployment()`
- DevCycle 15h comment indicates delegation
**Risk**: Low - pure delegation

### ðŸ”µ Priority 4: Character Creation Workflow (Verify Usage)

#### 13-19. Character Creation Methods (Lines 1327-1487)
```java
private void resetCharacterCreationState()
private void handleCharacterArchetypeSelection(int archetypeIndex)
private void promptForCharacterRangedWeaponSelection()
private void handleCharacterRangedWeaponSelection(int weaponIndex)
private void promptForCharacterMeleeWeaponSelection()
private void handleCharacterMeleeWeaponSelection(int weaponIndex)
private void completeCharacterCreation()
```
**Status**: Workflow methods - verify if still used
**Reason**: 
- Part of character creation workflow
- May have been moved to CharacterCreationController
- Comments indicate delegation in DevCycle 15h
**Risk**: Medium - significant functionality, verify before removal

## Additional Unused Components

### Victory/Outcome Methods
Several methods related to victory outcomes and manual victory processing may also be unused:
- `promptForManualVictory()` - Line 1015
- `promptForNextFactionOutcome()` - Line 1056
- `handleVictoryOutcomeInput()` - Line 1066
- `cancelManualVictory()` - Line 1076

### Scenario Management Methods
Methods for new scenario creation may be delegated:
- `promptForNewScenario()` - Line 1085
- `executeNewScenario()` - Line 1124
- `cancelNewScenario()` - Line 1168

## Refactoring Impact Analysis

### DevCycle History
The class shows extensive refactoring across multiple DevCycles:
- **DevCycle 15c**: Component extraction began
- **DevCycle 15d**: Workflow components
- **DevCycle 15e**: Game state and combat components
- **DevCycle 15h**: Character creation and deployment controllers
- **DevCycle 15i**: Workflow state coordination
- **DevCycle 15j**: Scenario management simplification
- **DevCycle 15k**: Further delegation to components

### Component Extraction Pattern
Many methods follow this pattern:
1. Original implementation in InputManager
2. Functionality moved to dedicated component
3. Method becomes delegation wrapper
4. Method becomes unused as direct calls to component are made

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Remove `legacyValidateComponentIntegrity()`** - marked as legacy
2. **Remove `handleScenarioNameInput()`** - pure delegation
3. **Remove `promptForThemeSelection()`** - appears broken
4. **Remove `getThemeDisplayName()`** - orphaned utility

### Verification Required (Priority 2)
1. **Use IntelliJ "Find Usages"** on each Priority 2 method
2. **Check if display methods** are called from event handlers
3. **Verify character generation** is not used in deployment

### Refactoring Opportunities (Priority 3)
1. **Replace delegation methods** with direct component calls
2. **Move remaining logic** from mixed delegation methods
3. **Consolidate similar functionality** across components

### Long-term Cleanup (Priority 4)
1. **Extract character creation workflow** if not already in dedicated controller
2. **Review victory/scenario methods** for similar delegation patterns
3. **Consider breaking InputManager** into smaller, focused classes

## File Impact Assessment

### Lines of Code Reduction
**Conservative Estimate**: 150-200 lines (8-11% reduction)
**Aggressive Estimate**: 400-500 lines (22-28% reduction)

### Complexity Reduction
- Eliminate unused method complexity
- Reduce cognitive overhead for developers
- Simplify class responsibility
- Improve maintainability

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Pure delegation and utility methods
- **Medium Risk**: Display and formatting methods
- **High Risk**: Complex business logic methods (character generation)

## Testing Strategy

### Before Removal
1. **Run full compilation** - `mvn compile`
2. **Run existing tests** - `mvn test`
3. **Manual testing** of all workflows
4. **IntelliJ usage analysis** for each method

### After Removal
1. **Regression testing** of all input workflows
2. **Character creation testing** if those methods removed
3. **Save/load testing** for delegation changes
4. **UI interaction testing** for display methods

## Conclusion

The InputManager class contains significant technical debt from its refactoring history. Many methods are either unused delegation wrappers or orphaned functionality that has been moved to dedicated components. 

**Recommended approach:**
1. Start with Priority 1 methods (immediate removal)
2. Verify Priority 2 methods with IntelliJ usage analysis
3. Refactor Priority 3 delegation methods
4. Carefully evaluate Priority 4 workflow methods

This cleanup will significantly improve code maintainability while reducing the class size by approximately 10-25% and eliminating cognitive overhead from unused functionality.
