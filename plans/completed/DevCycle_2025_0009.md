## Overview
This development cycle focuses on implementing **core melee combat mechanics** for OpenFields2. The primary objective is to create a functional dual weapon system where characters can equip melee weapons, toggle between combat modes, and perform basic melee attacks.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement dual weapon system (ranged + melee weapons per character)
- Create basic melee combat mechanics with attack resolution and damage
- Enable manual weapon mode switching via M key toggle
- Provide foundation for enhanced melee features in DevCycle 10

**Scope**: Core functionality only - defense systems, advanced skills, and tactical positioning are deferred to DevCycle 10 for manageable implementation scope.

**Prerequisites:** 
- Existing ranged combat system from previous cycles
- Character statistics and skill system from DevCycle 7
- Character management foundation from DevCycle 8

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Focused on core combat mechanics with reduced scope for manageable implementation

## Design Clarifications Needed

### **CRITICAL QUESTIONS REQUIRING RESOLUTION**

**üìä FINAL STATUS**: All 10 sections fully resolved - ready for implementation!

**‚úÖ DESIGN COMPLETE**: All critical questions have been answered:

#### **1. Weapon Class Refactoring Scope** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Issue**: The existing `Weapon.java` class has many more fields than just `id`, `name`, `damage`.

**Decisions Made**:
- **Abstract Base Class Fields**: `id`, `name`, `damage`, `soundFile`, `weaponLength`, `weaponType`
- **Ranged-Specific Fields**: `ammunition`, `velocityFeetPerSecond`, `maxAmmunition`, `reloadTicks`, `reloadType`, `maximumRange`, `projectileName`, `firingDelay`, `currentFiringMode`, `availableFiringModes` stay in RangedWeapon
- **Melee Range Calculation**: `weaponLength` becomes base for melee `weaponRange` calculations

**Final Implementation**: 
- **Abstract Base Class Fields**: `id`, `name`, `damage`, `soundFile`, `weaponLength`, `weaponType`, `weaponAccuracy`, `states`, `initialStateName`
- **Ranged-Specific Fields**: `ammunition`, `velocityFeetPerSecond`, `maxAmmunition`, `reloadTicks`, `reloadType`, `maximumRange`, `projectileName`, `firingDelay`, `currentFiringMode`, `availableFiringModes` stay in RangedWeapon

#### **2. Automatic Defense System Performance** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Concern**: The plan specifies automatic defend attempts when targeted with 1-second cooldowns.

**Decisions Made**:
- **Event Queue**: Handle performance issues if they arise during implementation
- **Processing**: Defensive attempts processed immediately, not as scheduled events
- **Multiple Attackers**: Handled by 1-second cooldown between defensive actions
- **Rapid Attacks**: Attacks during cooldown period bypass defensive actions entirely, making multiple attackers more dangerous

#### **3. Weapon State Machine Conflicts** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Contradiction**: The plan states "defending is a free action without a weapon state" but also "Extend existing WeaponState enum with melee states."

**Decisions Made**:
- **Defense Tracking**: Only track defense cooldown, no separate defensive actions tracking
- **Defense During States**: Characters **CANNOT** defend while in `melee_attacking` or `switching_to_melee` states
- **Counter-Attacks**: Not implementing counter-attacks in this cycle - removed from scope

**Defense State Machine Analysis**:

**Option A: Separate Defense State Machine**
- **Pros**: Clean separation of concerns, defense logic independent of weapon state, easier to debug defense issues
- **Cons**: Additional complexity managing two state machines, potential synchronization issues, more memory overhead

**Option B: Defense as Part of Weapon States**  
- **Pros**: Single state machine to manage, simpler overall architecture, natural integration with weapon timing
- **Cons**: Weapon states become more complex, harder to add defense-only logic, coupling between defense and weapon mechanics

**Recommendation**: Use **Option A (Separate Defense State Machine)** because defense cooldowns and availability are independent of current weapon state and should work consistently across all weapon types.

**Final Decision**: **Separate Defense State Machine** (Option A) - defense cooldowns and availability are independent of weapon state and work consistently across all weapon types.

#### **4. Attack Type Toggle Control** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Gap**: Phase 6 mentions "Add/find key command to toggle between Ranged/Melee attack type" but doesn't specify which key.

**Decisions Made**:
- **Key Assignment**: Use 'M' key for melee/ranged toggle (if not already used)
- **Control Type**: Simple toggle between ranged and melee combat modes
- **Interaction**: Toggle is separate from movement/aiming controls (W/S, Q/E)

**Final Decisions**:
- **Key Assignment**: 'M' key confirmed available for melee/ranged toggle
- **Persistence**: Attack type is persistent per character (remembers last mode)
- **Default Mode**: Characters still default to ranged combat mode initially

#### **5. Dual Weapon Character Integration** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Design Question**: How does dual weapon system integrate with existing character weapon field?

**Decisions Made**:
- **Current Field**: Character class has single `weapon` field that becomes `rangedWeapon`
- **New Field**: Add `meleeWeapon` field to Character class
- **Minimum Weapons**: All characters have "unarmed" as default melee weapon; ranged weapons are optional
- **Switching**: Manual switching via M key toggle between combat modes
- **Default Mode**: Characters default to ranged combat mode when both weapons available

#### **6. Range Detection and Switching Logic** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Ambiguity**: The plan mentions both "automatic weapon mode switching" and "toggle between attack types."

**Decisions Made**:
- **Switching Method**: Manual switching via M key toggle only
- **Out of Range**: Character automatically moves toward target when in melee mode but out of range
- **Auto-Suggestions**: No automatic weapon suggestions
- **Viable Options**: Combat mode (set by M key toggle) determines weapon choice, not optimal weapon analysis

#### **7. Defense Calculation Complexity** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Concern**: The defense success formula `Base 50% + Dexterity Modifier + (Weapon Skill Level √ó 5)` might be overpowered.

**Decisions Made**:
- **High Defense Success**: 87% defense success for elite characters (Dex 90, Skill 5) is intended
- **Maximum Rate**: Defense success capped at 99%
- **Critical Hit Interaction**: Defense calculation independent of critical hits and weapon accuracy
- **Weapon Type Variation**: Defense success does not vary by attacking weapon type

#### **8. Timeline and Scope Realism** ‚úÖ **DEFERRED TO TERMINAL**
**Current Concern**: Each phase estimated at 3-4 days seems optimistic for complex systems.

**Status**: All timeline and scope questions deferred to terminal discussion:
- Scope reduction for initial implementation
- Features that could be deferred to later cycles  
- Whether to implement basic melee first, then defense system later
- Realistic timeline assessment for this complexity level

#### **9. Save/Load Compatibility** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Gap**: New weapon system will affect save file structure.

**Decisions Made**:
- **Old Saves**: No migration support - old saves will be deleted
- **Migration**: No save format migration implementation needed
- **Default Melee**: Characters without melee weapons get "unarmed" as default

**Final Decision**: 
- **State Preservation**: Reset all weapons to default state on load (not "ready")
- **Default States**: Varies by weapon type - some sheathed, some holstered, some slung
- **Combat Mode**: Reset to default ranged combat mode on load

#### **10. Event Queue Integration** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Current Design Question**: How do melee events integrate with existing ranged combat event scheduling?

**Decisions Made**:
- **Same Queue**: Melee attacks use same event queue as ranged attacks
- **Mode Switching**: Characters toggle between modes, eliminating conflicts between ranged/melee events for same character
- **Attack Cancellation**: Scheduled ranged attacks are cancelled when switching to melee mode
- **Defense Actions**: Defend attempts do not cancel or delay other scheduled actions

**Final Decision**: Current event queue already handles same-tick events properly - no special prioritization needed for melee vs ranged events.

### **Architecture Decision: WeaponInterface vs Abstract Weapon Class**

**The Question**: Should we use `WeaponInterface` for common weapon functionality, or an abstract `Weapon` base class?

### **WeaponInterface Approach**

**Pros:**
- **Flexibility**: Classes can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for complex weapon types (e.g., a weapon that's both `WeaponInterface` and `ThrowableInterface`)
- **Loose Coupling**: Forces you to think about contracts rather than implementation details
- **Testability**: Easy to create mock implementations for testing
- **No Implementation Inheritance Issues**: Avoids problems with deep inheritance hierarchies
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new weapon categories without affecting existing code

**Cons:**
- **Code Duplication**: Common functionality must be implemented in each class or utility methods
- **No Shared State**: Can't provide default implementations for common fields like `id`, `name`, `damage`
- **More Boilerplate**: Each implementing class needs to write getter/setter methods
- **No Constructor Sharing**: Each class defines its own constructors

### **Abstract Weapon Base Class Approach**

**Pros:**
- **Code Reuse**: Shared fields (`id`, `name`, `damage`) and methods implemented once
- **Less Boilerplate**: Common functionality inherited automatically
- **Consistent Structure**: Enforces uniform weapon data structure
- **Constructor Sharing**: Base constructor handles common initialization
- **Default Implementations**: Can provide sensible defaults for common methods

**Cons:**
- **Single Inheritance Limitation**: Java classes can only extend one base class
- **Tight Coupling**: Changes to base class affect all subclasses
- **Less Flexible**: Harder to create weapons with multiple capabilities
- **Potential Over-Engineering**: May force artificial inheritance relationships
- **Harder Testing**: More complex to mock due to implementation inheritance

### **Final Decision: Abstract Weapon Base Class**

Given the current design with `RangedWeapon` and `MeleeWeapon` having similar core properties (`id`, `name`, `damage`), the **Abstract Weapon Base Class** approach has been selected because:

1. **Simpler Implementation**: Clear, distinct weapon types that benefit from shared structure
2. **Less Code Duplication**: Common fields and basic methods only need to be written once
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to core weapon properties happen in one place
4. **Use Case Fits**: No complex multi-capability weapons planned that would benefit from multiple interfaces

**Final Architecture:**
```java
public abstract class Weapon {
    protected String id;
    protected String name; 
    protected int damage;
    // Common methods and constructors
}

public class RangedWeapon extends Weapon { /* ranged-specific fields */ }
public class MeleeWeapon extends Weapon { /* melee-specific fields */ }
```

This design decision is reflected throughout the implementation plan above.

## **DESIGN SPECIFICATION COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**All critical questions have been resolved. The melee combat system design is now complete and ready for Phase 1 implementation.**

**Key Design Decisions Finalized:**
- **Abstract Weapon Base Class** with 9 common fields including `weaponAccuracy` and state management
- **Separate Defense State Machine** independent of weapon states  
- **M Key Toggle** for persistent per-character combat mode switching
- **Weapon State Reset** to default states (sheathed/holstered/slung) on save load
- **Existing Event Queue** handles same-tick event prioritization properly

**No additional questions needed - proceed to implementation planning.**
