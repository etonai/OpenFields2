*Created: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Implementation Update: 2025-06-30 at 20:45 | Implementation Status: **COMPLETED***

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on iteratively enhancing the melee combat system by implementing one system at a time. Each system will be planned, implemented, tested, and validated before adding the next system to the cycle. This approach ensures thorough testing and integration of each component while maintaining system stability.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Iteratively improve melee combat systems with focused, incremental changes
- Plan, implement, and test each system thoroughly before adding the next
- Maintain existing functionality while enhancing melee combat capabilities
- Build a foundation for advanced melee combat features in future cycles

**Prerequisites:** 
- Understanding of current melee combat system architecture
- Access to output.txt analysis showing the spam pattern
- Familiarity with Character, CombatCoordinator, and MeleeCombatSequenceManager classes

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Requires careful tracking of recovery state and moving audio triggers without breaking existing logic

### 5. Fix Melee Weapon State Validation Logic ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Root Cause Identification**
  - [x] Analyzed the gap between weapon ready state (tick 61) and attack attempt (tick 191)
  - [x] Identified mismatch: weapon shows "melee_ready" state but validation checks for "READY"
  - [x] Found the bug in MeleeCombatManager weapon state validation logic

  - [x] Identified the source of unexplained gap: tick 191 + 60 = 251, but impact at tick 312 (61 extra ticks)
  - [x] Found that executeMeleeAttack() was calling character.startAttackSequence() (ranged weapon logic)
  - [x] Discovered melee attacks were incorrectly going through complex ranged weapon state transitions
  - [x] Traced the issue to mixing melee and ranged attack execution paths

- [x] **Attack Execution Fix**

  - [x] Added proper recovery period management using character.startMeleeRecovery()
  - [x] Eliminated unnecessary ranged weapon state transitions from melee attacks

- [x] **Timeline Optimization**
  - [x] Melee attacks now proceed directly from execution to impact (no additional delays)
  - [x] Impact scheduled at currentTick instead of going through ranged weapon timing
  - [x] Recovery starts immediately after impact scheduling
  - [x] Complete attack flow: startMeleeAttackSequence → delay (60 ticks) → execute → immediate impact → recovery

### 7. Temporarily Disable Attack Blocking During Combat Development ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Attack Blocking Investigation**
  - [x] Located blocking system in DefenseManager.attemptBlock() method
  - [x] Identified integration points in CombatResolver and CombatCoordinator
  - [x] Found no existing configuration flags for defensive mechanics
  - [x] Determined cleanest approach: modify DefenseManager.attemptBlock() to return false

  - [x] Other combat mechanics (damage, recovery, audio) remain functional

### 8. Add Tick Count to Remaining Melee Attack Debug Messages ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Debug Message Audit**
  - [x] Located all remaining melee attack debug messages without tick counts
  - [x] Identified 4 messages needing updates in MeleeCombatManager.java
  - [x] Found messages: "scheduling melee attack", "executes melee attack", "target moved out of range", "target incapacitated"
  - [x] Verified currentTick parameter availability in all locations

- [x] **Implementation**
  - [x] Added tick count to "scheduling melee attack on X in Y ticks at tick Z" message
  - [x] Added tick count to "executes melee attack on X at tick Y" message  
  - [x] Added tick count to "target moved out of range before attack execution at tick Y" message
  - [x] Added tick count to "target incapacitated before attack execution at tick Y" message
  - [x] Tested compilation and verified consistent message formatting

- [x] **Debug Message Standardization**
  - [x] Ensured consistent format: "message at tick X" for all melee debug messages
  - [x] All 7 melee attack debug messages now include comprehensive timing information
  - [x] Complete debug message enhancement provides full timeline tracking capability

### 9. Fix Melee Attack Recovery State Blocking Despite System 7 Disable ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Issue Investigation**
  - [x] Identified two different blocking systems: defensive blocking (System 7) vs recovery state blocking
  - [x] Found that "still in recovery from previous attack" check occurs in CombatResolver.resolveMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Located source of blocking at line 366 in CombatResolver.java
  - [x] Determined this is separate from DefenseManager.attemptBlock() defensive blocking

- [x] **Recovery Blocking Analysis**
  - [x] Found "ATTACK BLOCKED: X is still in recovery" message in CombatResolver.java line 368
  - [x] Identified timing issue: recovery starts at tick 250, impact resolution also at tick 250
  - [x] Understanding: recovery check blocks impact resolution of the same attack that started the recovery
  - [x] Confirmed this is attacker recovery blocking, not defender defensive blocking

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Temporarily disabled recovery state blocking in CombatResolver.resolveMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Commented out canMeleeAttack() check with clear restoration markers
  - [x] Added DevCycle 33 System 9 tracking comments and TODO for re-enabling
  - [x] Preserved original logic for future restoration after timing coordination fixes

### 10. Make Blocking Disable Configurable Through Debug Configuration ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

  - [x] Updated DebugConfig class to load and provide access to new configuration options
  - [x] Replaced hard-coded disables in DefenseManager and CombatResolver with config checks
  - [x] Tested configuration loading and runtime behavior

- [x] **Enhanced Control and Documentation**
  - [x] Allow independent control of defensive blocking vs recovery blocking
  - [x] Document the new configuration options for future development
  - [x] Ensure configuration changes are picked up without code recompilation
  - [x] Validate that blocking can be re-enabled by changing config values

**System 2 Design Specifications:**
- **Investigation Focus**: Identify the system calling handleAttackContinuation() every tick during recovery
- **Fix Approach**: Address root cause rather than just blocking symptoms
- **Timing Goal**: Attack continuation should only trigger when recovery naturally ends or when re-targeting is needed
- **Integration Points**: Works with auto-targeting, persistent attack, and recovery systems
- **Performance Goal**: Eliminate unnecessary every-tick attack continuation calls
- **Debug Support**: Add debug logging to trace attack continuation call sources

**System 1 Design Specifications:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: Track recovery end tick per character to prevent overlapping attack scheduling (melee-specific only)
- **Audio Timing**: Audio plays only when attack executes successfully, not when scheduled (no additional throttling)
- **Integration Points**: Works with existing auto-targeting, persistent attack, and weapon state systems
- **User Interface**: No UI changes required - fix is purely backend logic
- **Performance Requirements**: Eliminate 60 audio events per second spam, reducing CPU/audio load
- **Recovery Persistence**: Recovery continues until natural end time regardless of weapon/mode changes
- **Debug Integration**: Recovery state transitions logged using existing combat debug flag
- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - Incapacitated characters: Cancel recovery (no further actions possible)
  - Incapacitated targets: Recovery continues regardless of target state
  - Mode switches: Recovery must complete before weapon switch completes
- **Save System**: Recovery state is transient and not saved

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Add recovery state tracking with duration storage for debugging
  - `src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java` - Fix handleAttackContinuation method, add edge case handling
  - `src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java` - Move audio trigger, add debug messages
- **New Classes/Enums**: None required
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes needed (recovery state not persisted)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Fully backwards compatible, purely bug fix
- **Thread Safety**: Simple field access (single-threaded tick system)
- **Testing Approach**: Manual testing focused on audio elimination

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`src/main/java/combat/Character.java`** - Add meleeRecoveryEndTick field and isInMeleeRecovery() method
- **`src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java`** - Add recovery check in handleAttackContinuation() before auto-targeting
- **`src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java`** - Move audio from scheduleMeleeAttack() to event execution

**New Components Required:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: meleeRecoveryEndTick (long) and recovery duration (long) fields in Character class
- **Recovery Validation**: isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick) method in Character class
- **Debug Integration**: Combat debug messages for recovery state transitions

### Data Flow
**Information flow for attack prevention:**
1. **Auto-targeting Trigger** → **Recovery State Check** → **Block or Allow Attack Scheduling**
2. **Melee Attack Schedule** → **Event Execution** → **Recovery Validation** → **Audio Playback**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - single long field per character
- **CPU Usage**: Significant reduction - eliminates 60 audio events per second
- **Rendering Impact**: None
- **Save File Size**: No change

  - [x] **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Melee debug requires Ctrl+D (debugMode) while ranged uses DebugConfig.isCombatDebugEnabled()

- [x] **Debug System Integration**
  - [x] Modified CombatResolver.resolveMeleeAttack() to use DebugConfig.isCombatDebugEnabled() instead of debugMode parameter
  - [x] Updated CombatResolver.calculateMeleeHit() to use DebugConfig instead of debugMode parameter

  - [x] Analyzed why no audio plays during manual melee attacks despite successful hits
  - [x] Identified timing issue: recovery starts before audio check runs in scheduled event
  - [x] Located problematic audio condition: `if (attacker.character.canMeleeAttack(attackTick))`
  - [x] Determined that System 1 audio relocation created timing dependency on recovery state

- [x] **Audio System Analysis**
  - [x] Confirmed System 1 audio relocation moved audio to OpenFields2.scheduleMeleeImpact() execution phase
  - [x] Found that MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() starts recovery BEFORE audio check runs
  - [x] Verified audio trigger exists in OpenFields2.scheduleMeleeImpact() but with problematic condition
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Recovery check `canMeleeAttack(attackTick)` returns false because recovery starts immediately

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Removed problematic recovery-dependent audio condition from OpenFields2.scheduleMeleeImpact()
  - [x] Replaced conditional audio with unconditional `playWeaponSound(weapon)` call
  - [x] Added System 13 comments explaining timing fix and recovery check removal
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds and audio will now play for all melee attacks

### 14. Fix Melee Weapon Visual State Not Rendering During Attacks ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Issue Investigation**
  - [x] Analyzed why melee weapons don't show attack animation/state during combat
  - [x] Confirmed same timing pattern as System 13 audio issue: visual state and impact on same tick
  - [x] Located the visual state transition in MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Determined visual state changes are affected by same-tick impact resolution timing

- [x] **Visual State System Analysis**
  - [x] Found weapon state changes to "melee_attacking" in MeleeCombatSequenceManager line 162
  - [x] Identified immediate impact scheduling on same tick (line 171) making visual state invisible
  - [x] Confirmed weapon rendering system correctly maps "melee_attacking" to ATTACKING visual state
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Zero-tick visual duration because impact happens immediately

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Added 10-tick visual delay between state change and impact scheduling
  - [x] Updated recovery timing to account for visual delay (attackTick + visualDelay + recoveryTime)
  - [x] Weapon now shows "melee_attacking" state for visible duration (~0.17 seconds) before impact
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds and visual state timing will now be visible

### 15. Fix Defensive Blocking Still Occurring Despite System 12 DefenseManager Fix ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Issue Investigation**
  - [x] Analyzed why "1001:Bobby attempts to defend but fails" still appears despite DefenseManager configuration
  - [x] Verified that DefenseManager.attemptBlock() was being called but initial condition allowed defense attempt
  - [x] Found that target.character.canDefend() check was bypassing configuration in CombatResolver line 387
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Defense attempt initiated before configuration check, allowing "attempts to defend" message

- [x] **Defense System Audit**
  - [x] Traced exact source of "attempts to defend but fails" message to CombatResolver line 422
  - [x] Confirmed target.character.canDefend() check exists and bypasses DefenseManager configuration
  - [x] Found initial condition allows defense logic to run even when defensive blocking disabled
  - [x] Identified that System 12 fixed DefenseManager but not the entry condition

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Added configuration check to initial defense condition: `!config.DebugConfig.getInstance().isDefensiveBlockingDisabled()`
  - [x] Combined with existing canDefend() check to prevent entire defensive logic when blocking disabled
  - [x] Now defensive attempts completely skipped when disableDefensiveBlocking is true
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds with complete defensive blocking disable

### 16. Fix Manual Melee Attack Visual Delay Missing (System 14 Bypass) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Visual State Investigation**
  - [x] Identified that manual melee attacks use different code path than System 14 targeted
  - [x] Found MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() bypasses MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Confirmed System 14 visual delay only applied to one code path, not manual attacks
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Two separate melee attack execution paths with only one having visual delay

- [x] **Attack Path Analysis**
  - [x] **Path 1 (has System 14 fix)**: Auto-targeting → MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack() → 10-tick delay
  - [x] **Path 2 (missing fix)**: Manual attacks → MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() → immediate impact
  - [x] Manual attacks (right-click movement) use MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() on line 126
  - [x] This path calls scheduleMeleeImpact() with currentTick instead of currentTick + visualDelay

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Added same 10-tick visual delay to MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() method
  - [x] Changed scheduleMeleeImpact() call from currentTick to currentTick + visualDelay
  - [x] Both manual and auto-targeting melee attacks now use consistent visual delay timing
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds with unified visual delay across all melee attack paths

### 17. Fix Missing Weapon State Change in Manual Melee Attack Path ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Issue Investigation**
  - [x] Analyzed user report: "first attack did not show weapon in correct position, but second attack did"
  - [x] Examined output.txt showing first attack at tick 251 and second attack at tick 511
  - [x] Discovered first attack uses MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() path
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Manual attack path missing weapon state change to "melee_attacking"

- [x] **Attack Path Analysis**
  - [x] Found MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() schedules impact but doesn't set weapon state
  - [x] Verified MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack() properly sets "melee_attacking" state
  - [x] Confirmed both paths have 10-tick visual delay but only one sets weapon state
  - [x] **Missing Component**: WeaponState attackingState assignment in manual attack execution

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Added weapon state change to "melee_attacking" in MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Used same pattern as MeleeCombatSequenceManager for consistency
  - [x] Ensured proper state transition: "melee_ready" → "melee_attacking" → impact → recovery
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds with complete weapon state management across all attack paths

### 18. Fix Weapon State Not Returning to Ready After Attack ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] **Issue Investigation**
  - [x] Analyzed user report: "weapon does move into attack state, but after that it doesn't move back to ready state"
  - [x] Examined output.txt showing no auto-targeting attempts after first attack recovery
  - [x] Discovered System 17 fixed weapon state setting but not weapon state return
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Manual attack path missing recovery event scheduling for weapon state return and auto-targeting resumption

- [x] **State Recovery Analysis**
  - [x] Found MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack() only calls startMeleeRecovery() but doesn't schedule state return
  - [x] Verified MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack() properly schedules weapon state return to "melee_ready"
  - [x] Confirmed MeleeCombatSequenceManager also calls checkContinuousAttack() to resume auto-targeting
  - [x] **Missing Components**: Recovery event scheduling with weapon state return and auto-targeting resumption

- [x] **Fix Implementation**
  - [x] Added weapon state return scheduling to MeleeCombatManager.executeMeleeAttack()
  - [x] Scheduled event for currentTick + visualDelay + recoveryTime to match MeleeCombatSequenceManager timing
  - [x] Added checkContinuousAttack() call to resume auto-targeting after recovery
  - [x] Verified compilation succeeds with complete recovery event scheduling for manual attack path

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insights**: The interaction between auto-targeting and recovery systems was creating unexpected behavior. Auto-targeting running every tick while recovery blocks attacks creates inefficiency that compounds quickly in combat scenarios.
- **Process Improvements**: Root cause analysis was crucial - System 1 addressed symptoms while System 2 fixed the actual cause. Future cycles should always investigate whether blocking mechanisms indicate upstream issues.
- **Design Decisions**: Using existing recovery state tracking (`isInMeleeRecovery()`) rather than creating new state variables maintained consistency and reduced complexity.

### Future Enhancements
- **Ranged Weapon Recovery Analysis**: Investigate if similar issues exist with ranged weapon recovery timing
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider reducing auto-targeting frequency for engaged characters
- **State Machine Consideration**: Evaluate formal state machine if attack flow becomes more complex

## Planning Questions for System 2 Review

### Root Cause Analysis Questions

1. **Auto-targeting Call Source**: Based on my investigation, I found that `updateAutomaticTargeting` is called every tick from the main game loop (OpenFields2.java line 153). For characters with auto-targeting enabled and a valid current target, lines 106-149 in AutoTargetingSystem.java may initiate attacks. Should we add a check to prevent re-initiating attacks when `isAttacking` is already true, or is there a deeper issue?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, we should add a check to prevent re-initiating attacks during recovery. The current `isAttacking` check at line 40 in AutoTargetingSystem.java is insufficient because `isAttacking` is cleared when recovery starts (line 180 in MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java), allowing auto-targeting to immediately try starting new attacks during recovery.

2. **Recovery State Persistence**: When a melee attack completes and enters recovery, the `isAttacking` flag is cleared (MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java line 180). This allows auto-targeting to immediately try to start a new attack on the next tick. Should `isAttacking` remain true during the recovery period to prevent this?
   
   **Answer**: Rather than changing the semantics of `isAttacking`, we should add a specific recovery check to auto-targeting. The `isInMeleeRecovery()` method already exists and should be used in the auto-targeting system to prevent attacks during recovery.

3. **Attack Continuation vs Auto-targeting**: There appear to be two systems that can trigger attacks:
   - `checkContinuousAttack` called after recovery ends (line 187 in MeleeCombatSequenceManager)
   - `updateAutomaticTargeting` called every tick from the game loop
   
   Are both systems necessary, or should auto-targeting be disabled during active combat sequences?
   
   **Answer**: Both systems serve different purposes. Auto-targeting should handle initial target acquisition for idle characters, while `checkContinuousAttack` should handle attack continuation after recovery. Auto-targeting should be disabled during active combat sequences (attacking, recovering, moving to melee).

### Design Questions

4. **Recovery State Management**: Should we introduce a new state like `isRecovering` that's separate from `isAttacking`, or should we extend the meaning of `isAttacking` to include the recovery period?
   
   **Answer**: Use the existing `isInMeleeRecovery()` method rather than creating new state variables. This maintains consistency with the existing recovery tracking system implemented in System 1.

5. **Attack Continuation Timing**: Currently, `checkContinuousAttack` is scheduled to run when recovery ends. Should this be the only way to continue attacks for characters in persistent attack mode, rather than having auto-targeting also trigger attacks?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, `checkContinuousAttack` should be the only way to continue attacks for characters already in combat. Auto-targeting should only initiate attacks for idle characters who don't have a current target or combat sequence in progress.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Would it be better to have auto-targeting check less frequently (e.g., every 10 ticks) rather than every single tick, especially when a character is already engaged in combat?
   
   **Answer**: Keep the current frequency but add early exit conditions. Checking every tick is acceptable for idle characters needing target acquisition, but characters in combat should exit early from auto-targeting checks.

### Implementation Questions

7. **Attack State Machine**: Should we implement a more formal state machine for attack sequences that includes states like IDLE, ATTACKING, RECOVERING, READY_TO_ATTACK to better control when new attacks can be initiated?
   
   **Answer**: No, avoid over-engineering. Use the existing boolean checks (`isAttacking`, `isInMeleeRecovery()`, `isMovingToMelee`) but ensure they cover the complete attack lifecycle. A formal state machine would add complexity without clear benefit.

8. **Auto-targeting Scope**: Should auto-targeting only be responsible for initial target acquisition and leave attack continuation to the existing persistent attack system?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, auto-targeting should only handle initial target acquisition for idle characters. Once a character enters any phase of combat (attacking, recovering, moving to melee), other systems should handle the progression.

### Technical Questions

9. **Event Scheduling**: When auto-targeting tries to start an attack while in recovery, does it create duplicate scheduled events, or does the recovery check in `handleAttackContinuation` prevent this?
   
   **Answer**: It creates unnecessary calls to `handleAttackContinuation` which then get blocked by the recovery check. This is inefficient and creates the "spam" we're trying to eliminate. Prevention at the auto-targeting level is more efficient.

10. **Melee vs Ranged**: Does the same issue occur with ranged weapons, or is this specific to melee combat due to how recovery is handled differently?
    
    **Answer**: This needs investigation. Ranged weapons may have different recovery handling. The fix should check if the character is in any combat-related state that should prevent new attack initiation, regardless of weapon type.

## Recommendations for System 2

Based on my analysis, here are my recommendations for each question:

1. **Add Early Exit Check**: Add `if (character.isAttacking || character.isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick)) return;` at the beginning of the auto-targeting check (line 115 in AutoTargetingSystem.java).

2. **Keep isAttacking True**: Modify the recovery scheduling to not clear `isAttacking` until recovery actually completes, not when it starts.

3. **Separate Responsibilities**: Auto-targeting should only handle initial target acquisition. Once combat starts, let the persistent attack system handle continuation.

4. **Use Existing Recovery Check**: The `isInMeleeRecovery()` method already exists. Use it in auto-targeting rather than creating new state variables.

5. **Single Continuation Path**: Only use `checkContinuousAttack` for attack continuation. Auto-targeting should skip characters who are in any phase of an attack sequence.

6. **Conditional Frequency**: Check auto-targeting every tick only for idle characters. Skip characters who are attacking, recovering, or reloading.

7. **Lightweight State Check**: Instead of a full state machine, use the existing boolean checks but ensure they cover the complete attack lifecycle.

8. **Limited Auto-targeting Role**: Yes, auto-targeting should only acquire targets for idle characters and let other systems handle active combat.

9. **Add Debug Logging**: Add logging to track when auto-targeting attempts to start attacks during recovery to verify the fix.

10. **Check Both Systems**: Verify if ranged weapons have the same issue. If not, align melee recovery handling with ranged weapon recovery.

**Primary Recommendation**: The simplest fix is to modify line 115 in AutoTargetingSystem.java to check for melee recovery:
```java
if (character.isMovingToMelee || character.isAttacking || 
    (character.isMeleeCombatMode && character.isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick))) {
    return;
}
```

This prevents auto-targeting from attempting to start new attacks during the recovery period, eliminating the root cause of the excessive `handleAttackContinuation` calls.
