# Melee Combat System Enhancements - DevCycle 2025_0033
*Created: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Implementation Update: [TBD] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on iteratively enhancing the melee combat system by implementing one system at a time. Each system will be planned, implemented, tested, and validated before adding the next system to the cycle. This approach ensures thorough testing and integration of each component while maintaining system stability.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Iteratively improve melee combat systems with focused, incremental changes
- Plan, implement, and test each system thoroughly before adding the next
- Maintain existing functionality while enhancing melee combat capabilities
- Build a foundation for advanced melee combat features in future cycles

**Prerequisites:** 
- Understanding of current melee combat system architecture
- Access to output.txt analysis showing the spam pattern
- Familiarity with Character, CombatCoordinator, and MeleeCombatSequenceManager classes

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Requires careful tracking of recovery state and moving audio triggers without breaking existing logic

## System Implementations

### 1. Stop Attack Scheduling During Recovery ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Recovery State Tracking Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add meleeRecoveryEndTick field to Character class
  - [ ] Add meleeRecoveryDuration field for debugging purposes
  - [ ] Implement isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick) method
  - [ ] Update recovery tracking when melee attacks are scheduled
  - [ ] Add debug messages for recovery state transitions
  - [ ] Handle recovery cancellation when character becomes incapacitated

- [ ] **Attack Continuation Logic Fix**
  - [ ] Add recovery check in CombatCoordinator.handleAttackContinuation()
  - [ ] Prevent auto-targeting from triggering new attacks during recovery
  - [ ] Ensure legitimate attack continuation after recovery ends (same tick)
  - [ ] Implement weapon switch blocking during recovery
  - [ ] Test interaction with existing persistent attack and auto-targeting systems

- [ ] **Audio Trigger Relocation**
  - [ ] Remove audio playback from MeleeCombatSequenceManager.scheduleMeleeAttack() line 168
  - [ ] Move audio trigger to inside scheduled event execution
  - [ ] Only play audio after successful recovery validation
  - [ ] Maintain audio for successful attacks while eliminating spam

**Design Specifications:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: Track recovery end tick per character to prevent overlapping attack scheduling (melee-specific only)
- **Audio Timing**: Audio plays only when attack executes successfully, not when scheduled (no additional throttling)
- **Integration Points**: Works with existing auto-targeting, persistent attack, and weapon state systems
- **User Interface**: No UI changes required - fix is purely backend logic
- **Performance Requirements**: Eliminate 60 audio events per second spam, reducing CPU/audio load
- **Recovery Persistence**: Recovery continues until natural end time regardless of weapon/mode changes
- **Debug Integration**: Recovery state transitions logged using existing combat debug flag
- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - Incapacitated characters: Cancel recovery (no further actions possible)
  - Incapacitated targets: Recovery continues regardless of target state
  - Mode switches: Recovery must complete before weapon switch completes
- **Save System**: Recovery state is transient and not saved

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Add recovery state tracking with duration storage for debugging
  - `src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java` - Fix handleAttackContinuation method, add edge case handling
  - `src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java` - Move audio trigger, add debug messages
- **New Classes/Enums**: None required
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes needed (recovery state not persisted)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Fully backwards compatible, purely bug fix
- **Thread Safety**: Simple field access (single-threaded tick system)
- **Testing Approach**: Manual testing focused on audio elimination

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`src/main/java/combat/Character.java`** - Add meleeRecoveryEndTick field and isInMeleeRecovery() method
- **`src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java`** - Add recovery check in handleAttackContinuation() before auto-targeting
- **`src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java`** - Move audio from scheduleMeleeAttack() to event execution

**New Components Required:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: meleeRecoveryEndTick (long) and recovery duration (long) fields in Character class
- **Recovery Validation**: isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick) method in Character class
- **Debug Integration**: Combat debug messages for recovery state transitions

### Data Flow
**Information flow for attack prevention:**
1. **Auto-targeting Trigger** → **Recovery State Check** → **Block or Allow Attack Scheduling**
2. **Melee Attack Schedule** → **Event Execution** → **Recovery Validation** → **Audio Playback**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - single long field per character
- **CPU Usage**: Significant reduction - eliminates 60 audio events per second
- **Rendering Impact**: None
- **Save File Size**: No change

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
- [ ] **Recovery State Logic**
  - [ ] Test isInMeleeRecovery() returns true during recovery period

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Auto-targeting Disruption**: Low - Auto-targeting might not resume properly after recovery - Mitigation: Test auto-targeting continuation scenarios

### Schedule Risks
- **Complexity of Audio Relocation**: Low - Moving audio trigger is straightforward but requires careful testing - Contingency: Fallback to audio throttling if relocation proves problematic

### Quality Risks
- **Regression in Melee Combat**: Medium - Changes might break existing melee combat functionality - Testing strategy: Comprehensive regression testing of all melee scenarios
