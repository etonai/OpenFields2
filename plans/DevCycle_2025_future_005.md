# DevCycle 2025-Future-005: Cover System - Height-Based Protection

## Core Concept: Height-Dependent Coverage
Cover effectiveness varies based on character stance and cover height relative to line of sight.

### Half-Height Cover Protection
- **Prone Characters**: 100% cover (completely protected behind half-height obstacles)
- **Kneeling Characters**: High protection percentage (75-90% based on cover height)
- **Standing Characters**: Moderate protection (25-50% based on cover height)
- **Crouching Characters**: Intermediate protection between kneeling and standing

### Full-Height Cover Protection
- **Complete Obstruction**: 100% protection when cover completely blocks line of sight
- **Partial Obstruction**: Variable protection based on visible target percentage

## Partial Cover Calculation System

### The 100% / 75% / 50% / 25% / 0% Protection Model
When full-height cover only partially obscures a target, calculate protection based on visible target area.

### Geometric Calculation Method
1. **Primary Line**: Draw line from weapon tip to target center point
2. **Perpendicular Construction**: From target center, draw perpendicular line to target circle perimeter
3. **Intercept Points**: Find where perpendicular line intersects target circle
4. **Visibility Sampling**: Use 5 sample points around target perimeter:
   - Center point
   - Two intercept points  
   - Two midpoints between center and intercepts
5. **Visibility Percentage**: Calculate how many sample points are visible from weapon position
6. **Protection Assignment**: Map visibility to protection tiers (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

### Implementation Considerations
- **Ray Casting**: Use line-of-sight calculations from weapon to each sample point
- **Cover Detection**: Determine which obstacles intersect each ray
- **Height Calculations**: Factor in attacker height, target stance, and cover height
- **Real-time Updates**: Recalculate protection as characters move or change stance

## Cover System Integration Points
- **Movement System**: Stance changes (prone, kneeling, standing) affect cover effectiveness
- **Combat System**: Protection percentages modify hit calculations
- **AI Behavior**: Characters seek appropriate cover based on stance and threat assessment
- **Visual Feedback**: Display cover effectiveness indicators for player awareness

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Cover System Implementation
- **Geometry Utilities**: New classes for line-of-sight and coverage calculations
- **Cover Objects**: Extend terrain system to include height-based cover elements
- **Stance Management**: Integrate with existing movement system for character postures
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for real-time coverage calculations

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Design and prototype cover system geometry
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate cover calculations with combat system
3. **Phase 3**: AI and player interface enhancements for cover utilization

## Research Questions
- What performance impact will real-time cover calculations have?
- How should cover effectiveness integrate with existing accuracy modifiers?
- Should different weapon types have different cover penetration capabilities?
- How should stance transitions affect cover effectiveness in real-time?
- What visual indicators will best communicate cover effectiveness to players?
