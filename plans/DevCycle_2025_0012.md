*Created: June 19, 2025 at 12:27 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 19, 2025 at 12:41 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: [TBD] at [TBD] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
Implementation of character generation improvements and system balance refinements following DevCycle 11's health scaling changes. This cycle addresses the current uniform 100 health assignment issue and enhances character system visibility through improved tracking and display capabilities.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Replace uniform health generation with archetype-based varied health ranges
- Enhance combat experience tracking with separate melee/ranged statistics
- Improve character stats display to show both weapon types and combat modes
- Add audio feedback for melee combat through weapon sound effects

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 11 health scaling system (20 base → 100 base) completed
- Existing character archetype system in CharacterFactory
- Melee combat system from DevCycle 9
- Audio system infrastructure for weapon sounds

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Character generation changes with multiple system enhancements

## System Implementations

### 1. Archetype-Based Health Generation System ⭕ **PENDING**

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`CharacterFactory.java`** - Update archetype methods with varied health generation
- **`Character.java`** - Add separate combat tracking fields and methods
- **`InputManager.java`** - Enhance character stats display with new information
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Update combat resolution for tracking and sound effects

**New Components Required:**
- **None**: All enhancements work within existing class structure

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Character Creation** → **Health Generation Algorithm** → **Archetype-Based Health Assignment**
2. **Combat Action** → **Combat Type Detection** → **Appropriate Statistics Update**
3. **User Stats Request** → **Enhanced Display System** → **Comprehensive Character Information**
4. **Melee Attack** → **Combat Resolution** → **Sound Effect Playback**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - few additional integer fields per character

## Plan Analysis - Questions Resolved

*The following questions were raised during comprehensive analysis of this development plan. Responses have been incorporated into the implementation approach:*

### Key Implementation Decisions

#### Health Generation System
- **Game Balance**: Health variation will not affect existing combat balance calculations - system is designed to handle varied health values
- **Player Psychology**: No safeguards needed against players creating multiple characters for high health values
- **Range Overlap**: Overlapping health ranges between archetypes (Scout 50-90, Medic 60-90) are acceptable
- **Distribution**: No guarantees needed for health distribution patterns - natural randomness is sufficient

#### Combat Experience Tracking
- **Save File Migration**: Existing save files with conflicts will be deleted rather than migrated
- **Wound Type Integration**: Separate melee/ranged tracking will not integrate with wound severity tracking - wound descriptions already indicate cause
- **Thread Safety & Performance**: Not a concern for current implementation scope

#### Stats Display Enhancement
- **UI Space**: Console-based display has sufficient space for additional information
- **Missing Weapons**: Existing behavior (no display for missing weapons) is acceptable
- **Accessibility & Performance**: Not required for current implementation

#### Melee Combat Sound Effects
- **Audio Overlap**: Will be addressed during implementation if needed
- **Volume Balancing & System Failure**: Not a concern for current scope

### Testing Strategy Simplified

#### Manual Testing Approach
- **Mixed Combat Scenarios**: Manual testing will verify melee/ranged combat switching
- **Health Generation**: Manual testing with small character sets (no stress testing needed)
- **Balance Testing**: Qualitative assessment through gameplay rather than quantitative metrics

#### Scope Limitations
- **Small Character Sets**: System designed for smaller number of characters, not mass character creation
- **No Save File Recovery**: Corrupted save files will not be recovered
- **No Performance Optimization**: Performance concerns deferred to future cycles

### Architecture Decisions

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Save Files**: No backward compatibility requirements for current implementation
- **Future Extensibility**: Extensibility for additional features not a current concern

#### User Experience
- **Health Range Disclosure**: Players will not see archetype health ranges during character creation
- **Combat Mode Feedback**: No special feedback needed for combat mode switching
- **Sound Preferences**: No user configuration options for sound effects

### Implementation Focus Areas

Based on the resolved questions, the implementation will focus on:

1. **Simple Health Generation**: Implement archetype-specific ranges without complex distribution guarantees
2. **Basic Combat Tracking**: Add separate melee/ranged counters without integration complexity
3. **Enhanced Console Display**: Expand stats display with available information
4. **Basic Sound Integration**: Add melee combat sounds with simple implementation

### Deferred Concerns

The following areas have been explicitly deferred to future cycles or marked as non-concerns:
- Performance optimization and stress testing
- Advanced audio system integration
- Accessibility features
- Complex save file migration strategies
- Quantitative balance metrics
- Future extensibility architecture

---

## Final Implementation Specifications

*Based on clarifying questions and responses, the implementation approach has been refined:*

### Technical Implementation Approach

#### Health Generation System
- **Implementation**: Single new method in CharacterFactory that takes archetype as parameter
- **Method Design**: `generateArchetypeHealth(String archetype)` for future extensibility
- **Save File Handling**: No save file conflict handling required - will be managed externally

#### Combat Experience Tracking
- **Data Migration**: No save file migration logic required - existing conflict handling managed externally
- **Field Initialization**: New combat tracking fields will be added to Character class with zero initialization

#### Stats Display Enhancement
- **Display Format**: Preferred format for console output:
  ```
  Ranged: Colt Peacemaker (6 damage, 0 accuracy)
  Melee: Steel Dagger (6 damage, 15 accuracy, 5.5ft reach) [ACTIVE]
  ```
- **Active Mode Indication**: Current active weapon mode shown with [ACTIVE] tag

#### Melee Combat Sound Effects
- **Implementation Pattern**: Follow existing ranged weapon sound implementation pattern
- **Integration**: Use same audio system and timing as ranged combat sounds

### Development Execution Plan

**Implementation Order**: All four systems will be implemented in the planned phase order:
1. Phase 1: Health Generation + Combat Tracking fields
2. Phase 2: Combat resolution integration + Enhanced stats display  
3. Phase 3: Sound effects integration + comprehensive testing
4. Phase 4: Final validation and documentation
