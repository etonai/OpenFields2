**Prerequisites:** 
- All functionality must remain exactly as it was before DevCycle 15
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces
- Thorough testing at each incremental step

**Estimated Complexity:** Low-Medium - Conservative, safe improvements only

## Lessons Learned from DevCycle 15

### What Went Wrong
- **Overly Aggressive Refactoring**: Attempted to restructure too much at once
- **Insufficient Integration Testing**: Components weren't properly tested together
- **Lost Implicit Dependencies**: Broke subtle inter-component relationships
- **Missing Functionality Validation**: Didn't verify all features still worked

### Improved Approach for 15a
- **Incremental Changes Only**: Small, safe improvements with thorough testing
- **Preserve All Functionality**: Zero tolerance for feature regressions
- **Better Documentation**: Understand existing code before making changes
- **Test-Driven Improvements**: Test current behavior before improving it

### Future Refactoring Guidelines
1. **Document existing behavior** thoroughly before making changes
2. **Create comprehensive tests** for current functionality first
3. **Make incremental changes** with testing at each step
4. **Preserve all interfaces** and existing API contracts
5. **Validate functionality** extensively after each change
