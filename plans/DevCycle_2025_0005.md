- **Coordinate Accuracy**: No offset between click position and movement target
- **Visual Consistency**: Target display matches actual character movement destination
- **Camera Independence**: Fix works correctly regardless of camera position/zoom
- **Real-time Updates**: Target updates correctly when clicking during movement

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Investigate**: `InputManager.java`, `GameRenderer.java`, `Unit.java`
- **Focus Areas**: Mouse click coordinate transformation, camera offset/zoom calculations
- **Testing Method**: Visual verification with clicks at known screen coordinates
- **Root Cause**: Likely mismatch between InputManager and GameRenderer coordinate transformations

### 3. Weapon Length Property System ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Weapon Class Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add weapon length property to Weapon class (in feet)
  - [ ] Update weapon loading system to read length from JSON data
  - [ ] Modify WeaponFactory to assign length property during weapon creation
  - [ ] Update weapon serialization/deserialization for save compatibility
  - [ ] Add validation for weapon length values (positive numbers only)

- [ ] **Replace Hardcoded Length Values**
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded length calculations from GameRenderer.getWeaponLength()
  - [ ] Update GameRenderer to use weapon.length property instead
  - [ ] Convert existing length system from pixels to feet consistently
  - [ ] Test weapon rendering with dynamic length values
  - [ ] Verify weapon positioning accuracy across all weapon types

- [ ] **Weapons.json Data Population**
  - [ ] Add weaponLength field to all weapons in weapons.json files
  - [ ] Set pistol weapons to 1.0 feet (7 pixels equivalent)
  - [ ] Set rifle weapons to 4.0 feet (28 pixels equivalent)  
  - [ ] Set submachine gun weapons to 2.5 feet (17.5 pixels equivalent)
  - [ ] Set other weapons to appropriate length values
  - [ ] Update all theme-specific weapon files consistently

**Design Specifications:**
- **Property Type**: Double value representing weapon length in feet
- **JSON Field Name**: "weaponLength" for consistency with existing naming
- **Default Value**: 1.0 feet for weapons without specified length
- **Conversion Factor**: 7 pixels = 1 foot (maintain existing scale)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Assign default length values for weapons.json files without length property
- **Validation**: Weapon length must be positive, reasonable values (0.1 to 10.0 feet)

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `combat/Weapon.java`, `GameRenderer.java`, `data/WeaponFactory.java`
- **JSON Updates**: All `weapons.json` files in theme directories
- **Migration Strategy**: Use default length values, no save file migration needed
- **Testing Focus**: Verify visual accuracy of weapon rendering after conversion

### 4. Submachine Gun Rendering Fix ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Rendering Position Correction**
  - [ ] Analyze current submachine gun positioning logic in GameRenderer
  - [ ] Identify why submachine guns use pistol-style positioning (14 pixels offset)
  - [ ] Update weapon positioning logic to treat submachine guns like rifles
  - [ ] Ensure submachine gun base starts at circle tangent point
  - [ ] Test visual accuracy of submachine gun positioning

- [ ] **Weapon Type Positioning Logic**
  - [ ] Review GameRenderer.renderWeapon() positioning calculations
  - [ ] Separate pistol-specific positioning from other weapon types
  - [ ] Group rifle and submachine gun positioning logic together
  - [ ] Implement clear weapon type-based positioning rules
  - [ ] Add comments explaining positioning rationale for each weapon type

- [ ] **Visual Validation and Testing**
  - [ ] Compare submachine gun rendering with rifle rendering
  - [ ] Verify submachine gun appears as "short rifle" not "long pistol"
  - [ ] Test positioning accuracy across different character handedness
  - [ ] Validate weapon state positioning (ready vs aiming) works correctly
  - [ ] Ensure weapon rotation and facing work properly with corrected positioning

**Design Specifications:**
- **Positioning Rule**: Submachine guns use rifle-style tangent positioning, not pistol offset
- **Base Position**: Weapon base starts exactly at unit circle tangent point
- **Length Rendering**: Full weapon length extends from tangent point toward target
- **State Consistency**: Ready and aiming states both use rifle-style positioning
- **Visual Goal**: Submachine gun should look like compact rifle, not extended pistol

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `GameRenderer.java` renderWeapon() method
- **Logic Change**: Update weapon positioning switch statement for SUBMACHINE_GUN case
- **Testing Method**: Visual comparison with rifle positioning behavior
- **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with weapon length property system (Task 3)



## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **MIT License + All Systems**: Independent - license implementation does not affect other systems
- **Movement Bug Fix + Weapon Rendering**: Independent - coordinate fixes don't impact weapon positioning
- **Weapon Length System + Submachine Gun Fix**: Direct dependency - submachine gun fix depends on weapon length properties
- **Priority Conflicts**: Movement bug takes precedence as it affects core user experience
- **Event Queue Management**: No new scheduled events introduced in this cycle
- **Save Data Coordination**: No save/load coordination required (user specified not to worry about save files)

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **MIT License**: Highest priority - establishes legal framework, completely independent implementation
2. **Movement Target Bug Fix**: High priority - critical user experience issue, independent implementation  
3. **Weapon Length Property System**: Medium priority - foundation for submachine gun fix
4. **Submachine Gun Rendering Fix**: Low priority - depends on weapon length system, visual polish

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`LICENSE`** - New MIT license file in project root
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Add licensing section documentation
- **`InputManager.java`** - Fix coordinate transformation for movement targets
- **`GameRenderer.java`** - Verify coordinate system consistency and weapon positioning logic
- **`Unit.java`** - Review movement target handling
- **`combat/Weapon.java`** - Add weaponLength property with getter/setter
- **`data/WeaponFactory.java`** - Load weapon length from JSON data
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/*/weapons.json`** - Add weaponLength field to all weapons

**New Components Required:**
- **weaponLength property**: Double field in Weapon class representing length in feet
- **License headers**: Standard MIT license headers for main Java source files

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Mouse Click** → **InputManager coordinate transformation** → **Unit movement target with visual feedback**
2. **JSON weapon data loading** → **WeaponFactory with length property** → **Dynamic weapon rendering in GameRenderer**
3. **License file creation** → **Documentation updates** → **Legal framework establishment**
4. **Weapon length property** → **Updated submachine gun positioning** → **Accurate visual weapon rendering**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - one additional double field per weapon instance
- **CPU Usage**: Negligible - coordinate fixes are simple calculations, license has no runtime impact
- **Rendering Impact**: None - visual fixes improve accuracy without performance cost
- **Save File Size**: Not applicable - user specified not to worry about save file compatibility
