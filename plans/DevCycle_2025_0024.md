# Iterative System Improvements - DevCycle 2025_0024
*Created: 2025-06-26 at 10:30 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-26 at 10:30 | Last Implementation Update: [Date] at [Time] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview

This development cycle takes an iterative approach to implement various system improvements and enhancements. Unlike typical cycles that plan multiple features upfront, DevCycle 24 will work on one improvement at a time in an iterative fashion: identify enhancement → plan implementation → code → test → commit → identify next improvement.

The first improvement focuses on enhancing the burst mode firing system to make burst firing more resilient to interruption. Currently, if a shooter is hit and incapacitated during burst mode, the burst is cancelled. The goal is to modify the system so that remaining shots in a burst continue to fire even if the shooter becomes incapacitated, simulating the realistic scenario where a burst already in progress continues due to trigger pull momentum and weapon mechanics.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Take iterative approach to system improvements, one enhancement at a time
- Phase 1: Implement burst mode resilience to incapacitation (first improvement)
- Maintain existing system mechanics throughout changes
- Improve system robustness through focused, incremental enhancements
- Complete full cycle (analyze → implement → test → commit) before moving to next improvement

**Prerequisites:** 
- Working knowledge of current systems and architecture
- Project compiles successfully and runs correctly
- Understanding of iterative development methodology

**Estimated Complexity:** Variable - Individual improvements range from Low to Medium complexity, but total scope depends on improvements identified

## System Implementations

### 1. Burst Mode Resilience System ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Incapacitation Handling During Burst**
  - [ ] Identify current burst cancellation logic when shooter is hit
  - [ ] Modify burst interrupt conditions to exclude incapacitation
  - [ ] Ensure burst timing continues normally for incapacitated shooters
  - [ ] Test burst completion with incapacitated shooter
  - [ ] Validate that other interruption conditions still work

- [ ] **State Management for Incapacitated Burst Shooters**
  - [ ] Ensure weapon states are properly maintained during incapacitation
  - [ ] Verify that incapacitated units can complete scheduled burst events
  - [ ] Test that burst shots fire at correct timing intervals
  - [ ] Validate accuracy penalties apply correctly to remaining shots

**Design Specifications:**
- **Incapacitation Resilience**: Burst mode continues firing remaining shots even if shooter becomes incapacitated during the burst sequence
- **Timing Preservation**: Existing firingDelay timing between shots is maintained regardless of shooter's health status
- **Accuracy Consistency**: Accuracy modifiers (first shot normal, subsequent shots -20) apply the same way for incapacitated shooters
- **Other Interruptions Preserved**: Mode switches, new attacks, and hesitation still cancel bursts as before
- **State Management**: Incapacitated shooters maintain proper weapon states until burst completion

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `src/main/java/OpenFields2.java` (burst mode logic, incapacitation handling)
- **Focus Areas**: `scheduleBurstShot()`, `executeWeaponAttack()`, character incapacitation methods
- **Backwards Compatibility**: No save format changes required, purely behavioral modification

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Burst Mode + Incapacitation System**: Incapacitation no longer interrupts active bursts, but other state changes still do
- **Weapon State + Health System**: Weapon states persist through incapacitation during burst sequences
- **Combat Events + Scheduler**: Burst events continue to execute on schedule regardless of shooter health status

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Burst Mode Resilience**: Core functionality change - highest priority
2. **State Management**: Ensuring proper weapon/unit states - high priority

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Modify burst interrupt logic, incapacitation handling during bursts

**Key Methods to Examine:**
- Methods that handle burst interruption/cancellation
- Character incapacitation logic that might affect weapon states
- Burst scheduling and execution methods

### Data Flow
**Information flow for burst resilience:**
1. **Shooter Hit During Burst** → **Check Interrupt Conditions** → **Continue if Only Incapacitated**
2. **Burst Event Scheduled** → **Execute Despite Incapacitation** → **Fire Remaining Shots**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - no new data structures required
- **CPU Usage**: No additional computational overhead
- **Rendering Impact**: No changes to visual systems
- **Save File Size**: No save format changes

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
- [ ] **Burst Resilience Core Logic**
  - [ ] Test burst continues when shooter incapacitated mid-burst
  - [ ] Test burst timing remains correct for incapacitated shooter
  - [ ] Test accuracy modifiers still apply to remaining shots

### System Integration Testing
- [ ] **Burst + Incapacitation Interactions**
  - [ ] Test burst completion after shooter incapacitation
  - [ ] Test that other interruption conditions still work (mode switch, new attack)
  - [ ] Test multiple shooters with mixed burst/incapacitation scenarios

### User Experience Testing
- [ ] **Gameplay Balance Testing**
  - [ ] Test that burst resilience feels realistic and balanced
  - [ ] Test edge cases with rapid incapacitation and burst timing
  - [ ] Verify visual/audio feedback is appropriate for incapacitated burst completion

### Technical Validation
- [ ] **Compilation and Build**
  - [ ] `mvn compile` passes without errors
  - [ ] `mvn test` passes all existing tests
  - [ ] No new warnings or deprecations introduced

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Estimated: 2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze current burst mode implementation
- [ ] Identify specific interrupt conditions and logic
- [ ] Document current incapacitation effects on weapon states

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Estimated: 3 hours)
- [ ] Modify burst interrupt logic to exclude incapacitation
- [ ] Test basic burst continuation with incapacitated shooter
- [ ] Validate timing and accuracy mechanics

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Estimated: 2 hours)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of burst resilience
- [ ] Verify other systems still work correctly
- [ ] Performance and edge case validation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization (Estimated: 1 hour)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with burst resilience mechanics
- [ ] Final testing and validation
- [ ] Documentation of implementation changes

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Code Review Checklist**
  - [ ] Changes are minimal and focused on burst resilience
  - [ ] No unintended side effects on other weapon systems
  - [ ] Code maintains existing patterns and style
  - [ ] Proper error handling for edge cases

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md Updates**
  - [ ] Document burst resilience behavior in burst firing section
  - [ ] Update any relevant combat mechanics descriptions

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **State Management Complexity**: Medium - Ensuring proper weapon states for incapacitated units during burst
- **Unintended Side Effects**: Low - Changes should be isolated to burst interrupt logic
- **Performance Impact**: Low - No additional processing overhead expected

### Quality Risks
- **Edge Case Bugs**: Medium - Complex interaction between incapacitation and burst timing
- **Balance Issues**: Low - Should not significantly affect game balance

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Burst mode continues firing when shooter becomes incapacitated mid-burst
- [ ] All existing burst mechanics (timing, accuracy) work identically
- [ ] Other interrupt conditions (mode switch, new attack, hesitation) still cancel bursts
- [ ] No impact on single-shot or full-auto firing modes

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Code compilation without errors or warnings
- [ ] All existing weapon functionality preserved
- [ ] Burst resilience works as specified
- [ ] No performance degradation

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Burst completion feels realistic and natural
- [ ] Visual and audio feedback appropriate for incapacitated burst firing
- [ ] System behavior is consistent and predictable
