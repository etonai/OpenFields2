*Created: June 22, 2025 | Last Design Update: June 22, 2025 | Last Implementation Update: [Pending] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
DevCycle 15j completes the unfinished objective from DevCycle 15i by achieving the original 800-1,000 line target for InputManager through systematic code removal and delegation to the established services. This cycle focuses on removing extracted code blocks from InputManager while preserving all functionality through proper delegation to WorkflowStateCoordinator, InputValidationService, InputDiagnosticService, and InputPatternUtilities.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- **Achieve the original 800-1,000 line target** for InputManager.java (currently 2,562 lines)
- **Remove workflow state management code** and delegate to WorkflowStateCoordinator
- **Remove validation logic blocks** and delegate to InputValidationService
- **Remove diagnostic code blocks** and delegate to InputDiagnosticService
- **Replace pattern implementations** with InputPatternUtilities calls
- **Maintain 100% functionality** through proper delegation patterns

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15i must be complete (all services created and integrated)
- WorkflowStateCoordinator, InputValidationService, InputDiagnosticService, and InputPatternUtilities must be functional
- All existing input workflows must remain operational
- Project must compile and pass all tests

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Systematic code removal with established delegation patterns but requires careful preservation of functionality
