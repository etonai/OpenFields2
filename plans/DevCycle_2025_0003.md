# Advanced Targeting and UI Enhancement - TODO List  
*Created: June 12, 2025 at 12:05 AM PDT | Last Design Update: June 12, 2025 at 1:26 AM PDT*

## 1. Automatic Targeting Change System
- [ ] **Smart Target Switching Implementation**
  - [ ] Add 1-second delay event when current target becomes incapacitated
  - [ ] Implement automatic target selection for closest available target
  - [ ] Maintain shooting state during target transition
  - [ ] Handle target switching during burst and full auto modes
  - [ ] Preserve automatic targeting state across target changes

- [ ] **Target Transition Logic**
  - [ ] Continue current firing action until target incapacitated
  - [ ] Schedule target reassessment event 1 second after incapacitation
  - [ ] Search for new valid targets within engagement range
  - [ ] Begin aiming sequence at new target automatically
  - [ ] Handle case when no valid targets remain available

**Design Specifications:**
- **Timing**: 1-second delay between target incapacitation and new target selection
- **Target Selection**: Closest available target (or within target zone if defined)
- **Firing Continuity**: No interruption to current burst/auto fire sequences
- **Mode Preservation**: Automatic targeting setting remains enabled
- **Scope**: Applies to all firing modes (single, burst, full auto)
- **Faction Targeting**: Automatic target selection respects faction alignment (enemies only)
- **Very Careful Aiming**: Maintain timing progress and shoot at incapacitated character
- **Multiple Incapacitations**: Each shooter handles its own independent 1-second delay
- **Target Zone Priority**: Always prioritize target zone targets first, even if closer targets exist outside zone
- **Range Limitations**: Use weapon-based maximum range, no target selection if none within range
- **Incapacitated Target Mechanics**: Incapacitated targets remain valid and can take additional damage
- **Hesitation Conflict**: Both hesitations apply independently, order doesn't matter
- **Target Validation**: Only out-of-range targets are invalid for resume mechanics

## 2. Cease Fire Command
- [ ] **Self-Target Cease Fire Implementation**
  - [ ] Detect right-click on already selected character
  - [ ] Stop current shooting action immediately
  - [ ] Maintain aiming direction at last target
  - [ ] Preserve weapon ready state
  - [ ] Handle cease fire during burst and auto modes

- [ ] **Cease Fire State Management**
  - [ ] Cancel scheduled shooting events
  - [ ] Stop ammunition consumption
  - [ ] Maintain target acquisition for resume capability
  - [ ] Update UI to reflect ceased fire state
  - [ ] Allow normal targeting to resume with new right-click commands

**Design Specifications:**
- **Trigger**: Right-click on already selected shooting character
- **Action**: Immediate cessation of shooting, maintain aiming
- **State**: Weapon remains ready, target remains acquired
- **Resume**: Normal right-click targeting resumes shooting
- **Modes**: Works with single shot, burst, and full auto modes
- **Multi-Character Selection**: Right-clicked character ceases fire, other selected characters target the clicked one
- **Visual Feedback**: No visual indication of cease fire state (future enhancement)
- **Queued Events**: All scheduled burst/auto fire events cancelled immediately
- **Very Careful Aiming**: Cease fire interrupts all aiming sequences (confirmed behavior)
- **Resume Mechanics**: Resume targeting requires same target (by Character ID), only out-of-range targets are invalid
- **Multi-Character Targeting**: Other selected characters target cease-fire character (incapacitated targets remain valid)

## 3. Enhanced Firing Mode Mechanics
- [ ] **Burst Mode Aiming Enhancement**
  - [ ] First shot uses normal aiming speed calculation
  - [ ] Subsequent shots apply quick aiming speed penalties
  - [ ] Shots fire at maximum weapon rate of fire
  - [ ] Maintain burst sequence timing integrity
  - [ ] Apply accuracy penalties for rapid follow-up shots

- [ ] **Full Auto Mode Aiming Changes**
  - [ ] First shot uses current aiming speed setting
  - [ ] Automatically switch to quick aiming after first shot
  - [ ] Maintain quick aiming for duration of auto fire
  - [ ] Allow manual targeting restart to reset aiming speed
  - [ ] Apply continuous quick aiming penalties to sustained fire

**Design Specifications:**
- **Burst First Shot**: Uses character's current aiming speed setting
- **Burst Follow-up**: Quick aiming speed accuracy penalties only
- **Auto First Shot**: Uses character's current aiming speed setting
- **Auto Sustained**: Automatic quick aiming speed for all subsequent shots
- **Timing**: Shots fire at weapon's maximum rate of fire capability
- **Accuracy**: Progressive penalties for rapid fire sequences
- **Burst Shot Count**: Fixed at 3 rounds (future enhancement: weapon-dependent burst sizes)
- **Manual Aiming Override**: Full auto allows aiming speed changes, stops firing to re-aim, reverts to quick after first shot
- **Very Careful Aiming Transition**: Accumulated aiming time preserved when switching firing modes, restarted when target switches
- **Penalty Application**: Quick aiming penalties apply immediately to second shot
- **Mode Switching**: Switching firing modes stops shooting and requires re-aiming (begins immediately)
- **Ammunition Management**: Rounds consumed in real-time
- **Full Auto Duration**: Same termination conditions as automatic targeting (manual stop, target change, out of ammo)

## 4. Target Zone System
- [ ] **Target Zone Definition and Storage**
  - [ ] Add Rectangle targetZone field to Character class
  - [ ] Implement mouse-driven rectangle selection interface

  - [ ] Select closest target within target zone first
  - [ ] Fall back to closest overall target if zone empty
  - [ ] Apply target zone logic to automatic target switching
  - [ ] Handle target zone boundaries and edge cases

**Design Specifications:**
- **Storage**: Rectangle coordinates stored in Character class
- **Selection**: Mouse drag interface for zone definition
- **Priority**: Zone targets selected before global closest target
- **Visualization**: Yellow rectangle outline when single character selected (hidden for multi-character selection)
- **Fallback**: Global closest target when no zone targets available
- **Persistence**: Target zones saved with character data
- **Rectangle Orientation**: Axis-aligned rectangles only (future enhancement: arc-based zones)
- **Coordinate System**: World-relative coordinates, zones do not move with characters
- **Dynamic Targeting**: Target reassessment only occurs when current target becomes incapacitated
- **Zone Size Limits**: No minimum/maximum size constraints
- **Line of Sight Integration**: Characters can target through walls within zone (future obstacle consideration)
- **Zone Selection UI**: Right-click and drag for zone selection when character selected
- **Zone Modification UI**: Key binding for clearing target zones (Z key recommended)
- **Multi-Character Zones**: Each character has independent target zone
- **Zone Size Edge Cases**: Small zones may contain no targets, large zones equivalent to no zone restriction

## 5. Enhanced Character Stats Display

  - [ ] Add Health, Faction, Weapon Name display (single character selection)
  - [ ] Show Standing/Kneeling/Prone position state (single character selection)
  - [ ] Display Current Movement type and Aiming Speed (single character selection)
  - [ ] Include Total hesitation time remaining (single character selection)
  - [ ] Display only character IDs and names for multi-character selection

**Design Specifications:**
- **Selection Format**: "Selected: [Unit ID]:[Nickname]"
- **Status Line 1**: Health, Faction, Weapon Name, Position State (single character only)
- **Status Line 2**: Current Movement, Aiming Speed, Hesitation Time (single character only)
- **Hesitation Tracking**: Real-time countdown of remaining hesitation
- **Integration**: Consistent display across all UI elements
- **Updates**: Real-time updates as character states change
- **Hesitation Synchronization**: Character hesitation tracker may be inaccurate if events cancelled/modified (acceptable for now)
- **Multi-Character Selection**: Display only character IDs and names
- **Display Location**: Console output only
- **Hesitation Breakdown**: Two values - total wound hesitation and total bravery failure hesitation
- **Real-Time Updates**: Display occurs only when character first selected or stats viewed (console output only)

- **Hesitation Tracking + UI**: Real-time updates to character display
- **Weapon Rendering + Movement**: Weapon direction updates during character rotation
- **Muzzle Flash + Rapid Fire**: Overlapping flashes for high rate of fire weapons
- **Save Compatibility**: New Character fields require save format updates

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Automatic Targeting**: Core combat flow enhancement (highest priority)
2. **Enhanced Stats Display**: User experience improvement (high priority) 
3. **Target Zone System**: Tactical control enhancement (high priority)
4. **Firing Mode Enhancements**: Combat realism improvement (medium priority)
5. **Cease Fire Command**: User control improvement (medium priority)
6. **Weapon Visual Rendering**: Visual feedback enhancement (lower priority)

**Event Queue Priority System:**
- **Priority Order**: Hesitation > Cease Fire > Automatic Targeting
- **Synchronization**: Multiple characters targeting incapacitated enemy get independent 1-second delay events
- **Conflict Resolution**: Target zone switching doesn't affect current target, cease fire overrides burst sequences
- **Very Careful Aiming Integration**: Firing mode switches preserve time, target switches restart timer

**Visual System Specifications:**
- **Rendering Priority**: Weapons (highest) → Muzzle Flash (medium) → Target Zones (lowest)
- **Multi-Character Selection**: Hide target zones, movement targets, and combat target indicators (weapon rendering remains visible)
- **Visual Overlap**: All simultaneous visual effects are acceptable (no conflicts)

**Integration with Previous Cycle Systems:**
- **Stray Shot Integration**: Target zones do not affect stray shot calculations
- **Bravery Check Impact**: Hesitation does not affect target acquisition timing
