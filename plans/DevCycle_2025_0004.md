*Created: June 12, 2025 at 11:00 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 13, 2025 at 12:32 PM PDT | Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED & TESTED*

## 1. Unit Direction and Rotation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Character Rotation Animation System**
  - [x] Implement rotation animation when character changes target direction
  - [x] Add rotation speed calculation (360 degrees per second)
  - [x] Track current facing direction vs target direction
  - [x] Smooth interpolation between current and target rotation
  - [x] Integration with weapon rendering direction updates

- [x] **Rotation State Management**
  - [x] Add current rotation field to Character or Unit class
  - [x] Track rotation animation progress and timing
  - [x] Handle rotation during movement and targeting changes
  - [x] Ensure rotation completes before weapon positioning updates
  - [x] Performance optimization for multiple rotating units

**Design Specifications:**
- **Rotation Speed**: 360 degrees per second (6 degrees per tick at 60fps)
- **Animation Trigger**: When character acquires new target or changes facing direction
- **Visual Integration**: Weapon direction should follow character rotation smoothly
- **Performance Requirements**: Smooth rotation animation for up to 10 characters simultaneously
- **State Persistence**: Current facing direction should be maintained through save/load operations

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Initial Facing Direction**: Random facing for characters without targets
- **Rotation During Movement**: Characters can rotate while moving
- **Mid-Rotation Target Changes**: Rotation restarts immediately when target changes
- **Small Angle Threshold**: Rotations less than 15 degrees are instantaneous
- **Default Facing**: North (0 degrees) for characters loaded without rotation data
- **Save Data**: Units require facing field in addition to location data

**Implementation Specifications (Final):**
- **Facing Storage**: Store current facing direction in Unit class as degrees (0-360)
- **No Target Behavior**: Characters maintain their last facing direction when no target
- **Movement Interaction**: Characters face their movement target while moving
- **Incapacitated Characters**: Incapacitated characters do not rotate when acquiring targets
- **Rotation Animation Timing**: Real-time rotation animation (not event-driven)
- **Coordinate System**: 0 degrees = North, clockwise rotation
- **Angle Wrapping**: Use shortest path rotation (10° to 350° goes: 10→9→...→1→0→359→...→350)

## 2. Weapon Rendering when Ready or Firing ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Weapon State Visual Differentiation**
  - [x] Implement different weapon positioning for ready/reloading states
  - [x] Add weapon rotation calculations for non-aiming states
  - [x] Create weapon state detection logic
  - [x] Integrate with existing weapon rendering system
  - [x] Test visual clarity between aiming and ready states

- [x] **Weapon-Specific Ready State Positioning**
  - [x] Pistol ready state: rotate 45 degrees towards unit center
  - [x] Rifle ready state: move 2 feet closer to target + rotate 60 degrees towards center
  - [x] Update weapon rendering calculations for each weapon type
  - [x] Ensure weapon positioning works with handedness
  - [x] Performance optimization for weapon state rendering

**Design Specifications:**
- **Pistol Ready State**: Rotate weapon 45 degrees towards unit circle center from aiming position
- **Rifle Ready State**: Move weapon 14 pixels (2 feet) closer to target, then rotate 60 degrees towards center
- **State Detection**: Based on currentWeaponState (ready, reloading vs aiming, firing)
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between aiming and ready weapon positions
- **Integration Points**: Must work with existing weapon rendering, handedness, and muzzle flash systems

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Pistol Rotation Direction**: Left-handed characters rotate clockwise, right-handed rotate counterclockwise (45 degrees towards unit center)
- **Rifle Distance Measurement**: "2 feet closer" measured from current tangent position, not unit center
- **Other Weapon States**: Weapons in drawing, holstered, unsheathing states are hidden (not rendered)
- **Non-Ready States**: Only ready, reloading, aiming, and firing states show weapon rendering

**Design Specifications (Final):**
- **Rotation Coordination**: Weapons rotate with character - maintain relative angle to character as character rotates to face target
- **Handedness Impact**: Handedness affects both tangent line selection (left/right side of circle) and rotation direction for ready state positioning

**Implementation Specifications (Final):**
- **Rotation Reference Point**: 45-degree rotation relative to line from unit center to target
- **Rifle Positioning**: Starting point moves 2 feet along tangent line toward target (not line shortening)
- **State Transitions**: Instant weapon position changes between ready/aiming states
- **Muzzle Flash**: Unaffected by ready state positioning (only shows during firing)
- **Very Careful Aiming**: Uses aiming weapon positioning (equivalent to normal aiming)

**Outstanding Questions:**
- **Tangent Line Integration**: How do ready state rotations interact with existing tangent line calculations from DevCycle 3? (Requires research)

- **Debug Persistence**: Reset debug mode each game session (don't persist)
- **Display Scope**: Show debug info for selected units only (current behavior)

- **Implementation**: Movement and aiming speed info already exists, just needs debug mode toggle

**Implementation Specifications (Final):**
- **Debug State Storage**: Store debug mode flag in main game class
- **CTRL-D Integration**: Use existing CTRL-D debug mode toggle
- **Display Logic**: Modify existing character info display (location to be determined during implementation)
- **Display Update**: Only when selection changes (no real-time updates)
- **Multi-Character Selection**: Hide movement type and aiming speed unless in debug mode
- **Performance Impact**: None (actually reduces rendered information)

## System Interaction Specifications
**Implementation guidelines for system interactions:**

- **Unit Rotation + Weapon Rendering**: Character rotation must coordinate with weapon direction updates
- **Submachine Gun + Weapon Rendering**: New weapon type must integrate with both aiming and ready state rendering
- **Character Save + Starting Characters**: New character data must be properly saved and loaded
- **Debug UI + Performance**: Debug display must not impact game performance when enabled

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Submachine Gun**: Foundation for weapon system changes, affects multiple other systems (highest priority)
2. **Character Save and Starting Characters**: Data integrity and new character setup (high priority) 
3. **Weapon Rendering when Ready or Firing**: Core visual enhancement that builds on existing system (high priority)
4. **Unit Direction and Rotation**: Visual enhancement that affects weapon rendering (medium priority)
5. **UI Info for Walk and Normal**: Debug feature enhancement (medium priority)
6. **Title Text**: Cosmetic improvement with minimal system impact (lower priority)

**Event Queue Priority System:**
- **Rotation Animation Events**: How do rotation animations integrate with existing event queue? Should they be interruptible?
- **Debug Mode Performance**: Should debug display updates be queued or handled in real-time?

**Visual System Specifications:**
- **Rendering Priority**: Unit rotation → Weapon state rendering → Debug text → Title text (startup only)
- **Multi-Character Selection**: Should debug info show for all selected characters? How does rotation animation work with multiple selections?
- **Visual Overlap**: How do debug info and weapon rendering interact? Should debug text avoid overlapping with weapon lines?

**Integration with Previous Cycle Systems:**
- **DevCycle 2025_0003 Integration**: How does unit rotation affect automatic targeting weapon direction? Do submachine guns work with target zones?
- **Weapon Rendering Coordination**: How do ready/aiming state changes interact with existing muzzle flash and weapon visual systems?
- **Performance Considerations**: Will rotation animation impact existing smooth weapon rendering and targeting systems?

**Integration Specifications (Updated):**
- **Save Format**: Units require facing field in addition to location data
- **Save Compatibility**: Ignore save file compatibility concerns for this cycle
- **Debug Mode**: Purely additive - no impact on existing systems
