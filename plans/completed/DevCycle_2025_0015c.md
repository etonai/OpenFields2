# InputManager Incremental Refactoring - DevCycle 2025_0015c
*Created: June 21, 2025 | Last Design Update: June 21, 2025 | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
Safe, incremental refactoring of InputManager leveraging the foundation established in DevCycles 15a and 15b. This cycle applies lessons learned from the failed DevCycle 15 by taking a conservative, test-driven approach to breaking down the monolithic InputManager into manageable components.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Extract 2-3 focused components from InputManager using proven safe patterns
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility throughout refactoring
- Apply comprehensive testing at each step using DevCycle 15b framework
- Establish proven incremental refactoring methodology
- Create foundation for future component extraction cycles

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15a completed (documentation, debug tools, utility extraction)
- DevCycle 15b completed (comprehensive testing framework and validation)
- All functionality verified working via DevCycle 15b testing procedures
- Zero tolerance for functionality regressions

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Incremental, well-tested component extraction

## Incremental Refactoring Strategy

### Conservative Approach Principles
1. **Extract only 2-3 components per cycle** - avoid overwhelming complexity
2. **Test after each extraction** - use DevCycle 15b framework for validation
3. **Maintain all existing interfaces** - zero breaking changes
4. **Preserve exact behavior** - no functional modifications
5. **Rollback capability** - ability to revert any changes that cause issues

*DevCycle 15c applies the lessons learned from DevCycle 15's failure by taking a conservative, well-tested approach to InputManager refactoring. By building on the foundation of DevCycles 15a and 15b, this cycle can safely begin the incremental component extraction process while maintaining 100% functionality and establishing a proven methodology for future improvements.*

## DevCycle 15c Planning Questions for User Review

### Component Selection Questions
1. Are InputEventRouter and InputStateTracker appropriate first components for extraction, or would you prefer different components?
2. Should we limit to just 2 components (Router + StateTracker) or include a third component in this cycle?
3. Do the selected components have clear enough boundaries for safe extraction?

### Methodology Questions
4. Is the incremental approach (extract → test → extract → test) preferable to extracting all components simultaneously?
5. Should we implement rollback automation, or is manual rollback sufficient for this cycle?
6. Do you want intermediate commits after each component extraction, or one commit per phase?

### Testing Integration Questions
7. Should we run the full DevCycle 15b test suite after each component extraction, or just critical path testing?
8. Do you want automated performance benchmarking, or is functional validation sufficient?
9. Should we establish new component-specific tests, or rely on the existing DevCycle 15b framework?

### Architecture Questions
10. Is the coordinator pattern appropriate for InputManager's role after extraction?
11. Should components communicate directly with each other, or only through InputManager coordination?
12. Do you want dependency injection for components, or simple initialization in InputManager?

### Risk Management Questions
13. What's the acceptable threshold for rolling back a component extraction?
14. Should we implement feature flags to disable new components if issues arise?
15. Do you want this cycle to establish methodology for future extractions, or focus purely on these specific components?
