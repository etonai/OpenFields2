# DevCycle 2025_0012 Bug Fix 01 - Ranged Combat Tracking Failure
*Created: June 19, 2025*

## Bug Description

**Issue**: Ranged combat successful hits and wounds inflicted are not being properly tracked in the separate tracking system implemented in DevCycle 12.

**Evidence**: 
```
Wounds Inflicted: 9 total (1 scratch, 3 light, 1 serious, 4 critical)
Ranged Combat: 30 attempted, 0 successful, 0 wounds inflicted
Melee Combat: 1 attempted, 1 successful, 1 wounds inflicted
Total Attacks: 31 attempted, 9 successful (29.0% accuracy)
```

**Analysis**: 
- Ranged attempts are being tracked correctly (30 attempted)
- Ranged successes are stuck at 0 despite 9 total successful attacks
- Ranged wounds are stuck at 0 despite 9 total wounds inflicted
- Legacy total tracking still works (9 successful attacks)
- Melee tracking appears to work correctly (1/1/1)

## Root Cause Investigation

The issue is likely in the combat resolution logic where I modified the tracking in `CombatResolver.java`. Two potential problems:

1. **Missing ranged tracking calls**: The ranged success/wound tracking might not be called in all ranged combat resolution paths
2. **Incorrect tracking logic**: The weapon type detection in `resolveCombatImpact` might not be correctly identifying ranged weapons

## Files to Investigate

1. **`CombatResolver.java`** - Combat resolution and tracking logic
2. **`OpenFields2.java`** - Ranged attack attempt tracking
3. **`Character.java`** - Tracking field definitions and methods

## Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Identify the Problem
- [x] Review all ranged combat resolution paths in `CombatResolver.java`
- [x] Check `resolveCombatImpact` method weapon type detection logic
- [x] Verify all places where `rangedAttacksSuccessful++` and `rangedWoundsInflicted++` should be called
- [x] Look for any missed ranged combat resolution paths (stray shots, direct hits, etc.)

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: OpenFields2.java uses old `resolveCombatImpact` method that only tracks legacy statistics. The new CombatResolver.java has correct ranged/melee tracking but isn't being used for ranged attacks.

**Problem Location**: 
- `OpenFields2.java:687-757` - Old impact resolution method (legacy tracking only)
- `OpenFields2.java:648` - Correctly tracks `rangedAttacksAttempted++`
- `OpenFields2.java:698` - Only tracks legacy `attacksSuccessful++`, missing `rangedAttacksSuccessful++`

**Solution**: Replace OpenFields2.java's direct impact resolution with CombatResolver calls, like melee attacks already do.

### Phase 2: Implement the Fix
- [x] Replace old resolveCombatImpact call with CombatResolver usage (OpenFields2.java:651-653)
- [x] Ensure ranged attacks use the same resolution system as melee attacks
- [x] Compile and verify fix builds successfully
- [x] Test the fix with both ranged and melee combat to ensure no regression

**FIX IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Modified `OpenFields2.java:651-653` to use `CombatResolver.resolveCombatImpact()` instead of legacy method
- Ranged attacks now use the same tracking system as melee attacks
- This should fix both `rangedAttacksSuccessful` and `rangedWoundsInflicted` tracking
- **Build Status**: ✅ Compiles successfully

### Phase 3: Validation
- [x] Test ranged combat tracking shows correct success count
- [x] Test ranged combat tracking shows correct wound count  
- [x] Verify melee tracking still works correctly
- [x] Ensure legacy total tracking remains accurate
- [x] Test with multiple characters and combat scenarios

## Expected Fix

After the fix, the output should show:
```
Wounds Inflicted: 9 total (1 scratch, 3 light, 1 serious, 4 critical)
Ranged Combat: 30 attempted, 8 successful, 8 wounds inflicted
Melee Combat: 1 attempted, 1 successful, 1 wounds inflicted  
Total Attacks: 31 attempted, 9 successful (29.0% accuracy)
```

## Implementation Notes

- This is a targeted bug fix, not a feature enhancement
- Focus on minimal changes to fix the tracking without affecting other systems
- Preserve all existing functionality while fixing the tracking gap
- Test thoroughly to ensure the fix doesn't break melee or legacy tracking

## Resolution Status

**RESOLVED** ✅ - DevCycle 2025_0012_bugs_01 completed successfully.

**Fix Summary**: Modified ranged combat to use CombatResolver for consistent tracking across all combat types. This ensures ranged attacks properly track successes and wounds in the separate tracking system introduced in DevCycle 12.
