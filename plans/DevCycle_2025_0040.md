# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0040
*Created: July 3, 2025 at 8:15 PM | Last Design Update: July 3, 2025 at 8:15 PM | Last Implementation Update: N/A | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on implementing melee combat enhancements to improve system stability and enhance game mechanics. The cycle will address defensive mechanics and testing infrastructure for the melee combat system.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **⚠️ CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Enhance melee combat defense mechanics with comprehensive defensive system revision
- Implement additional system improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- Enhanced Melee Combat System (DevCycle 14) provides foundation
- CombatCoordinator and manager pattern architecture in place
- Existing critical test suite and automation framework

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Defense system integration with existing combat architecture

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Test Implementation Questions
1. **Test Class Structure**: Should this be implemented as a new test class (e.g., `MeleeCombatTestAutomated`) or integrated into an existing test framework?
   **Recommendation**: Create a new test class `MeleeCombatTestAutomated` following the pattern of `HeadlessGunfightTest`. This provides clear separation of concerns and allows for melee-specific test validation while maintaining consistency with existing test infrastructure.

2. **Faction File Modifications**: The plan mentions modifying TestFactionAlpha.json and TestFactionBeta.json to add knife skills. Should these changes be permanent to the faction files, or should we create test-specific versions to avoid affecting other tests?
   **Recommendation**: Make permanent changes to the faction files. Adding knife skill level 1 to soldiers is a reasonable enhancement that won't break existing tests but will enable more comprehensive testing across the system. This follows the principle of improving test coverage without creating maintenance overhead.

3. **Test Execution Method**: Should this test be:
   - A standalone automated test that runs with `mvn test`?
   - An interactive test that requires manual game startup and selection?
   - Both (automated version for CI/CD and interactive for manual validation)?
   **Recommendation**: Standalone automated test that runs with `mvn test`. This ensures the defense system is validated in CI/CD pipelines and provides regression detection. The test should be fully automated like `HeadlessGunfightTest` for maximum reliability and minimal maintenance.

4. **Character Selection Automation**: The plan mentions "rectangular selection of both characters" - should the test framework automatically perform this selection, or is this a manual step for interactive testing?
   **Recommendation**: Since this should be a fully automated test (per recommendation #3), the "rectangular selection" requirement should be interpreted as ensuring both characters are properly configured for combat engagement, not as a UI interaction. The test framework should programmatically configure both characters without requiring selection mechanics.

5. **Success Criteria Definition**: What specific metrics define a successful test? For example:
   - Both characters must attempt defense at least X times?
   - Defense calculations must be within expected ranges?
   - Combat must last minimum/maximum duration?
   - Specific defensive success rate thresholds?
   **Recommendation**: Define success criteria as: (1) Both characters must attempt defense at least 3 times each, (2) Defense calculations must be within expected ranges (base roll 1-50, plus modifiers), (3) Combat must last at least 10 seconds to ensure meaningful engagement, (4) Defense statistics must be properly tracked and incremented, (5) Test must complete without exceptions or errors.

### Technical Implementation Questions
6. **Save File Location**: Should `test_d.json` be created in the same directory as existing test saves (`saves/` directory), and should it follow the same naming convention as other test files?
   **Recommendation**: Yes, create `test_d.json` in the `saves/` directory following existing convention. This maintains consistency with `test_b.json` used by `HeadlessGunfightTest` and ensures the test infrastructure can locate and load the save file properly.

7. **Test Data Validation**: How should the test validate that defense calculations are working correctly? Should it:
   - Log defense calculation components for manual review?
   - Assert specific ranges for defense values?
   - Compare defense statistics against expected baselines?
   **Recommendation**: Implement all three approaches: (1) Enable combat debug output for defense calculations, (2) Assert that defense values fall within expected ranges (1-50 base + modifiers = 1-86 max with knife skill +5 and weapon +6), (3) Validate that defense statistics increment properly and both characters attempt defenses during combat.

8. **Auto-Targeting Configuration**: Does "enable auto-targeting" mean setting the character property, or does it require additional test setup to ensure characters will automatically engage each other?
   **Recommendation**: Set the character property `autoTargeting = true` for both characters. This should be sufficient as it enables the existing auto-targeting behavior that makes characters automatically engage nearby enemies, similar to how `HeadlessGunfightTest` operates.

9. **Melee Combat Mode**: What exactly does "set both soldiers to melee combat mode" involve? Is this:
   - Setting a character property?
   - Ensuring they have melee weapons equipped?
   - Configuring their AI behavior?
   **Recommendation**: Set `isMeleeCombatMode = true` on both characters and ensure they have `mel_bowie_knife` equipped as their active melee weapon. This follows the existing character configuration pattern and ensures they will engage in melee rather than ranged combat.

10. **Test Isolation**: Should this test be designed to run independently of other tests, or can it depend on specific game state from previous tests?
    **Recommendation**: Design for complete test isolation. The test should initialize its own game state from `test_d.json` and not depend on other tests, following the pattern of `HeadlessGunfightTest`. This ensures reliable, repeatable test execution in any order.

### Scope and Requirements Questions
11. **Debug Output**: Should the test include debug output showing defense calculations in real-time, similar to the combat debug output in other tests?
    **Recommendation**: Yes, enable combat debug output specifically for defense calculations. This provides valuable validation data and follows the pattern of `HeadlessGunfightTest`. The debug output should show defense roll components, timing, and success/failure for each defense attempt.

12. **Performance Considerations**: Given the 1-minute duration, should the test include performance monitoring or timeout handling for slower systems?
    **Recommendation**: Implement timeout handling with a reasonable buffer (e.g., 90 seconds maximum) to prevent test hangs. Include basic performance monitoring to track test duration and ensure it completes within acceptable timeframes. Follow the pattern of `HeadlessGunfightTest` which includes timing information.

13. **Test Repeatability**: Should the test use fixed random seeds to ensure repeatable results, or allow randomness for more comprehensive testing?
    **Recommendation**: Allow randomness for comprehensive testing, similar to `HeadlessGunfightTest`. The test should validate that the defense system functions correctly across various random scenarios rather than testing one specific sequence. Statistical validation (defense attempts/successes) is more valuable than deterministic outcomes.

14. **Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure**: Should this test integrate with the existing headless test framework used by HeadlessGunfightTest?
    **Recommendation**: Yes, fully integrate with the existing headless test framework. Use the same initialization patterns, headless rendering setup, and test validation approaches as `HeadlessGunfightTest`. This ensures consistency, maintainability, and leverages proven test infrastructure.

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

*Note: This section will be updated as each system is completed and interactions are discovered.*

- **System 1 + Melee Combat System**: Defense system integrates with existing melee attack flow
- **System 1 + CombatCoordinator**: DefenseManager registered and managed by CombatCoordinator
- **Event Queue Management**: Defense calculations occur during melee hit determination phase
- **System 2 + System 1**: Test framework validates defense system implementation and statistics
- **System 2 + Character Skills**: Test requires knife skill integration for proper defense calculations
- **System 2 + Auto-Targeting**: Test relies on auto-targeting for autonomous combat engagement

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **System 1**: Defense system critical for melee combat balance ✅ **COMPLETE**
2. **System 2**: Test validation of System 1 defense mechanics (current priority)

## 🔄 CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ✅ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ❌ **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ✅ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ⭕ **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- 🚫 **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ✅ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

---

## ⚠️ ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ⚠️

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

---

*This iterative development cycle focuses on implementing one system at a time while maintaining flexibility for additional improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Technical Questions

EDNOTE: Use all recommendations

1. **Melee Weapon Skill Definition**: The defense calculation includes "(melee weapon skill × 5)" - which specific skill should be used? Should this be:
   - The character's skill with their currently equipped melee weapon type?
   - A new generic "Melee" skill that applies to all melee weapons?
   - Should characters without melee weapon skills use a default value?
   
   **Recommendation**: Use the character's skill with their currently equipped melee weapon type. This maintains consistency with the existing skill system where Pistol and Rifle skills apply to their respective weapon types. Characters without the appropriate skill should use 0 as the skill level, making untrained defenders less effective.

2. **Weapon Defense Bonus Source**: Where should the "weapon defense bonus" value come from?
   - Should this be a new field added to the Weapon class?
   - Should different weapon types have standard defense bonuses?
   - Should melee weapons have defensive values while ranged weapons do not?
   
   **Recommendation**: Add a new `defenseBonus` field to the Weapon class. This provides maximum flexibility for weapon variety. Melee weapons should typically have positive defense bonuses (e.g., sword +10, staff +15), while ranged weapons should have 0 or negative values since they're not designed for defense.

3. **Defense Manager Scope**: Should the DefenseManager handle:
   - Only the defense calculations and timing?
   - Also manage defensive animations or visual feedback?
   - Track defense statistics (successful defenses, damage mitigated)?
   
   **Recommendation**: Start with DefenseManager handling only calculations and timing, following the single responsibility principle. Visual feedback can be handled by the existing rendering system, and statistics can be tracked in the Character class alongside existing combat stats. This keeps the manager focused and testable.

### Implementation Questions

4. **Melee Attack Integration Point**: Where exactly in the current melee attack flow should defense be checked?
   - During the hit calculation phase before damage is determined?
   - As part of the existing attack resolution in CombatCoordinator?
   - Should defense be checked in the same location as ranged attack hit calculations?
   
   **Recommendation**: Check defense during the hit calculation phase, before damage is determined. This should happen in the same method that calculates melee hit chance, allowing the defense value to be applied as a negative modifier to the attacker's roll. This mirrors how other combat modifiers work in the system.

5. **Character Data Persistence**: For the nextDefenseTick field:
   - Should this be saved as part of CharacterData or just Character?
   - Should the field reset to 0 on game load or maintain its value?
   - How should this interact with character creation/faction loading?
   
   **Recommendation**: Keep nextDefenseTick as a runtime-only field in Character (not CharacterData). Reset it to 0 on game load, character creation, and faction loading. This treats defense cooldown as a combat state that doesn't persist between sessions, similar to weapon states resetting to holstered/slung.

### Game Design Questions

6. **Defense Availability**: Should defense be:
   - Automatic for all characters when eligible?
   - Require the character to be in a specific state (not incapacitated, not moving)?
   - Available even when the character is performing other actions?
   
   **Recommendation**: Defense should be automatic for all non-incapacitated characters when eligible. Allow defense while moving or performing other actions - this represents instinctive defensive reflexes. Incapacitated characters cannot defend (they can't actively parry or dodge).

7. **Multiple Attackers**: If multiple melee attacks occur before tick + 60:
   - Should the character defend against all eligible attacks?
   - Should defense only work against the first attack?
   - Should subsequent defenses have reduced effectiveness?
   
   **Recommendation**: Defense should work only against the first attack, then the cooldown applies. This creates tactical decisions about timing attacks and prevents defense from being overpowered against multiple attackers. It also keeps the system simple and predictable.

8. **Debug/Feedback Output**: What information should be displayed for defense actions?
   - Console output showing defense calculations and results?
   - Visual indicators in the game UI?
   - Statistics tracking for testing and balance purposes?
   
   **Recommendation**: Implement console output showing defense calculations (similar to existing hit/miss output). Format: "[Defender] defends: roll(X) + dex(Y) + skill(Z) + weapon(W) = total(T) vs attack". Add defense statistics to Character class (defensesAttempted, successfulDefenses) for testing and balance analysis.

### Edge Case Questions

9. **Incapacitated Defenders**: Should incapacitated characters:
   - Still be able to defend (passive defense)?
   - Have nextDefenseTick frozen at current value?
   - Reset nextDefenseTick to 0?
   
   **Recommendation**: Incapacitated characters cannot defend (no active defense possible). Keep nextDefenseTick at its current value (don't reset or update it). This way, if they're revived/healed, their defense cooldown state is preserved, preventing exploit of incapacitation to reset defense timing.

10. **Weapon Switching**: When a character switches weapons:
    - Should the defense calculation use the old or new weapon's stats?
    - Should nextDefenseTick reset or maintain its value?
    - How should this work if switching between ranged and melee weapons?
    
    **Recommendation**: Defense calculations should use the currently equipped weapon's stats at the time of defense. Maintain nextDefenseTick value when switching weapons - defense timing is about the character's readiness, not the weapon. When defending with a ranged weapon against melee, use the ranged weapon's defense bonus (likely 0 or negative).
