## Planning Questions for User Review

### Architecture and Design Questions
1. Should we consider using dependency injection framework (like Spring) for component management, or keep it lightweight with manual initialization?
2. Do you want to maintain the existing public API exactly, or can we make minor improvements to method naming and signatures?
3. Should we implement event-driven communication between components using Observer pattern, or direct method calls?
4. Is there a preference for component lifecycle management - lazy initialization vs. eager initialization?

### Implementation Priority Questions  
5. Which components should be prioritized first if we need to deliver incrementally - UnitCommandProcessor for gameplay or GameStateManager for save/load?
6. Should we implement rollback capability during the refactoring process, or is forward-only migration acceptable?
7. Do you want intermediate commits for each component extraction, or larger commits per phase?

### Testing and Validation Questions
8. What level of integration testing is required - should we test every component interaction or focus on critical paths?
9. Should we implement performance benchmarks before starting the refactoring to measure improvements?
10. Do you want automated testing for all 13+ input state transitions, or can we focus on the most critical ones?

### Risk Management Questions
11. Should we implement a feature flag system to quickly disable new components if issues arise?
12. What's the acceptable timeline extension if we discover additional complexity during implementation?
13. Should we plan for gradual user testing during development phases, or wait for complete implementation?

### Technical Specification Questions
14. Should InputStateManager use enum-based state machine or string-based states for flexibility?
15. Do you want component-to-component communication logged for debugging purposes?
16. Should we implement configuration files for component behavior, or keep everything in code?
