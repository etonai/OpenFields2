*Created: June 21, 2025 | Last Design Update: June 21, 2025 | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
Comprehensive testing and validation phase for InputManager following the conservative improvements completed in DevCycle 15a. This cycle focuses on validating all existing functionality works correctly and establishing robust regression prevention to avoid future DevCycle 15-style breakages.

**Development Cycle Goals:**

## DevCycle 15b Planning Questions for User Review

### Testing Scope and Priority Questions
1. Should we prioritize testing the exact features that broke in DevCycle 15 first, or take a comprehensive approach across all functionality?
2. Do you want manual testing with visual validation, or should we attempt to create automated integration tests?
3. Should we test individual features in isolation, or focus on end-to-end workflows that combine multiple features?

### Testing Methodology Questions
4. What level of documentation is needed for the behavior baseline - detailed technical specs or high-level functional descriptions?
5. Should we create formal test cases with pass/fail criteria, or use exploratory testing with notes?
6. Do you want performance benchmarks established, or is functional validation sufficient?

### Validation Depth Questions
7. Should we test all edge cases and error scenarios, or focus on the most common usage patterns?
8. How thoroughly should we test the debug features added in DevCycle 15a - basic functionality or comprehensive validation?
9. Should we validate the utility classes in real usage scenarios, or is the UtilityOnlyTest sufficient?

### Success Criteria Questions
10. What constitutes "comprehensive testing" for this cycle - percentage coverage, specific scenarios, or time-based effort?
11. Should we establish ongoing testing procedures for future InputManager changes, or focus only on current validation?
12. Do you want the testing results to inform future refactoring decisions, or purely serve as regression prevention?

### Timeline and Resource Questions
13. Is the 30-hour estimate (12+8+10) reasonable for this testing effort, or should we adjust scope?
14. Should this testing be done before starting any new development cycles, or can it run in parallel?
15. Do you want intermediate deliverables (e.g., test results after each phase), or final results only?
