# Weapon State Bug Fixes - DevCycle 2025_0026
*Created: 2025-06-27 at 10:00 AM | Last Design Update: 2025-06-27 at 10:00 AM | Last Implementation Update: 2025-06-27 at 10:20 AM | Implementation Status: Task 1 Complete*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on fixing weapon state progression bugs discovered after DevCycle 25. The primary issue was that weapon state transitions were skipping intermediate states due to hardcoded logic instead of following JSON-driven progression.

**Issue Discovered:**
- Weapon states were being skipped during attack sequences (e.g., ready → aiming instead of ready → pointedfromhip → aiming)
- `scheduleAttackFromCurrentState` method used hardcoded state transitions
- `scheduleReadyFromCurrentState` correctly used JSON-driven progression
- This inconsistency caused the MP5 to skip `pointedfromhip` state

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- ✅ Fix weapon state progression bug in `scheduleAttackFromCurrentState` method
- Ensure all weapon state transitions follow JSON weapon definitions
- Maintain compatibility with existing weapon hold state system

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 25 successfully completed and merged to main
- All existing tests passing
- No known critical bugs in weapon state system

**Estimated Complexity:** [To be determined] - [Based on selected features]

## System Implementations

### 1. Weapon State Progression Bug Fix ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Attack State Transition Logic**
  - [x] Replace hardcoded state transitions in `scheduleAttackFromCurrentState`
  - [x] Implement JSON-driven progression using weapon `action` field
  - [x] Ensure compatibility with existing aiming and firing logic
  - [x] Verify compilation and basic functionality
  - [x] Maintain weapon hold state system integration

**Design Specifications:**
- **Consistent JSON-driven Logic**: All weapon state transitions must follow the JSON weapon definitions using the `action` field
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing aiming and firing logic remains unchanged
- **Integration Points**: Works seamlessly with weapon hold state system from DevCycle 25
- **Performance**: No performance impact - same event queue and timing system
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if JSON action field is missing or invalid

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files Modified**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` (lines 1371-1384)
- **Changes Made**: Replaced hardcoded if-else state transitions with JSON-driven progression
- **Approach**: Used same pattern as `scheduleReadyFromCurrentState` method
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains all existing functionality, only fixes progression bug
