## Items for Future Consideration

### Prone Weapon Handling Enhancement
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 2 (Prone Combat)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Revisit prone weapon restrictions - consider whether some weapons (like rifles) should be easier to use when prone, providing accuracy bonuses or other advantages.

### Bravery Check Trigger Refinement
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 3 (Bravery Check)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Revisit bravery check trigger conditions - currently triggers on all misses, but could be refined to only trigger for near misses within a certain distance or only when directly targeted.

### Bravery Recovery Mechanics
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 3 (Bravery Check)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Implement bravery recovery system - consider how bravery penalties could decay over time, reset after combat, or be restored through rest/medical attention.

### Wound Healing System
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 6 (Movement Wound Penalties)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Implement comprehensive wound healing mechanics that would gradually restore movement capabilities and remove movement restrictions over time.

### Kneeling Position Combat Modifiers
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 1 (Enhanced Stray Shot System)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Handle kneeling character combat modifiers - accuracy penalties for shooting at kneeling targets, prone/kneeling transition timing, and other combat effects.

### Prone Character Rotation Ability
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 2 (Prone Combat System)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Determine whether prone characters can turn/rotate freely or are movement-restricted in terms of directional facing.

### Bravery Check Formula Refinement
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 3 (Bravery Check System)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Revisit the bravery check formula currently set as 50% + (2Ã—coolness modifier) to ensure proper balance and gameplay feel.

### Critical Wound Incapacitation System
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System 5 (Movement Wound Penalties)  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Allow some critically wounded characters to not be incapacitated, creating a middle ground between serious wounds and full incapacitation.

### Character Status UI Enhancement
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System Interaction Specifications  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Show a shortened version of the '?' character stats when a character is selected, displaying key status effects and conditions clearly to the player.

### Hesitation Status Display
**Source**: Tasks20250611_02.md - System Integration Questions  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Description**: Add hesitation information to character status display. Currently wounds and position states are shown in the '?' stat information, but hesitation states are not visible to the player.
