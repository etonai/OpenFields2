# Iterative System Improvements - DevCycle 2025_0024
*Created: 2025-06-26 at 10:30 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-26 at 10:51 | Last Implementation Update: [Date] at [Time] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview

This development cycle takes an iterative approach to implement various system improvements and enhancements. Unlike typical cycles that plan multiple features upfront, DevCycle 24 will work on one improvement at a time in an iterative fashion: identify enhancement → plan implementation → code → test → commit → identify next improvement.

The first improvement focuses on enhancing the burst mode firing system to make burst firing more resilient to interruption. Currently, if a shooter is hit and incapacitated during burst mode, the burst is cancelled. The goal is to modify the system so that remaining shots in a burst continue to fire even if the shooter becomes incapacitated, simulating the realistic scenario where a burst already in progress continues due to trigger pull momentum and weapon mechanics.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Take iterative approach to system improvements, one enhancement at a time
- Phase 1: Implement burst mode resilience to incapacitation (first improvement)
- Maintain existing system mechanics throughout changes
- Improve system robustness through focused, incremental enhancements
- Complete full cycle (analyze → implement → test → commit) before moving to next improvement

**Prerequisites:** 
- Working knowledge of current systems and architecture
- Project compiles successfully and runs correctly
- Understanding of iterative development methodology

**Estimated Complexity:** Variable - Individual improvements range from Low to Medium complexity, but total scope depends on improvements identified

## System Implementations

### 1. Burst Mode Resilience System ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Incapacitation Handling During Burst**
  - [x] Identify current burst cancellation logic when shooter is hit
  - [x] Modify burst interrupt conditions to exclude incapacitation
  - [x] Ensure burst timing continues normally for incapacitated shooters
  - [x] Test burst completion with incapacitated shooter
  - [x] Validate that other interruption conditions still work

- [x] **State Management for Incapacitated Burst Shooters**
  - [x] Ensure weapon states are properly maintained during incapacitation
  - [x] Verify that incapacitated units can complete scheduled burst events
  - [x] Test that burst shots fire at correct timing intervals
  - [x] Validate accuracy penalties apply correctly to remaining shots

**Design Specifications:**
- **Incapacitation Resilience**: Burst mode continues firing remaining shots even if shooter becomes incapacitated during the burst sequence
- **Timing Preservation**: Existing firingDelay timing between shots is maintained regardless of shooter's health status
- **Accuracy Consistency**: Accuracy modifiers (first shot normal, subsequent shots -20) apply the same way for incapacitated shooters
- **Other Interruptions Preserved**: Mode switches, new attacks, and hesitation still cancel bursts as before
- **State Management**: Incapacitated shooters maintain proper weapon states until burst completion

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files Modified**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` (burst mode logic, incapacitation handling)
- **Focus Areas**: Burst firing continuation logic, full-auto firing logic
- **Backwards Compatibility**: No save format changes required, purely behavioral modification

### 2. Character Class Refactoring ⭕ **PLANNED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
**Analysis Complete**: See `analysis/Character_Class_Refactoring_Analysis.md` for comprehensive breakdown

  - [x] Plan refactoring approach (extraction, organization, etc.)
  - [x] Create implementation strategy with minimal disruption

- [x] **Method Organization** ✅ PLANNED
  - [x] Group related methods together (combat, movement, state management, etc.)
  - [x] Extract utility methods into helper classes if appropriate
  - [x] Improve method naming and documentation
  - [x] Reduce method complexity where possible
  - [x] **Size Reduction Plan Created**: Comprehensive plan to reduce from 3,108 to <2,000 lines

- **Logical Grouping**: Group related functionality together for better comprehension
- **Documentation**: Add clear documentation for complex methods and field groups
- **Minimal Disruption**: Preserve all existing functionality and public interfaces
- **Testing Compatibility**: Ensure all existing tests continue to work

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` (primary refactoring target)
- **Focus Areas**: Method organization, field grouping, documentation, code structure
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain all public interfaces and existing behavior
- **Analysis Reference**: See `analysis/Character_Class_Refactoring_Analysis.md` for detailed breakdown

**Key Findings from Analysis**:
- **Current Size**: 3,108 lines, 225 methods, 86 fields (78 public!)
- **Major Issues**: Violates Single Responsibility Principle, handles 12+ distinct domains
- **Complexity**: Several methods exceed 100 lines (startAttackSequence: 199 lines)
- **Recommended Approach**: Phased refactoring starting with field encapsulation

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Burst Mode + Incapacitation System**: Incapacitation no longer interrupts active bursts, but other state changes still do
- **Weapon State + Health System**: Weapon states persist through incapacitation during burst sequences
- **Combat Events + Scheduler**: Burst events continue to execute on schedule regardless of shooter health status
- **Character Refactoring + All Systems**: Refactoring must preserve all existing interfaces and behavior to maintain compatibility

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Burst Mode Resilience**: Core functionality change - highest priority ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Character Class Refactoring**: Code quality improvement - high priority
3. **State Management**: Ensuring proper weapon/unit states - high priority
