*Created: 2025-06-20 at 09:26 PM PDT | Last Design Update: 2025-06-20 at 09:25 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: TBD | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
DevCycle 13 focuses on fixing critical bugs in the auto-targeting system that affect both ranged and melee combat mechanics. These bugs significantly impact automated combat functionality and visual realism during combat scenarios.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix auto-targeting melee weapon attack continuation issues
- Correct character facing direction during auto-targeting movement
- Resolve auto-targeting activation after manual shots

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 12 completed (enhanced combat tracking and character stats)
- Functional melee and ranged combat systems
- Existing auto-targeting framework

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Bug fixes in existing complex combat state management system

## System Implementations

### 1. Melee Auto-Targeting Continuation Fix ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**
  - [ ] Investigate why melee attacks stop after first attack in auto-targeting mode
  - [ ] Analyze melee attack state transitions and cleanup
  - [ ] Review auto-targeting loop continuation logic for melee weapons
  - [ ] Compare melee vs ranged auto-targeting state management

- [ ] **Melee Attack State Management**
  - [ ] Fix state transition bug preventing continued melee attacks
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup and reset of melee attack states
  - [ ] Verify auto-targeting continues when target remains valid
  - [ ] Test edge cases (target movement, incapacitation timing)

**Design Specifications:**
- **Continuous Attack Behavior**: Auto-targeting melee attacks should continue indefinitely as long as valid target exists
- **Target Switching**: When current target becomes invalid, immediately switch to nearest enemy using Euclidean distance
- **Target Selection**: Use random selection when multiple enemies are equidistant
- **Attack Completion**: Complete current attack if target becomes invalid during attack, then switch
- **Valid Targets**: Only alive enemies within melee range (exclude incapacitated targets)
- **Validation Timing**: Target validation occurs only when attacker begins an attack
- **State Consistency**: Melee attack state management should match ranged attack patterns where applicable
- **Performance Requirements**: No performance degradation from continuous melee attack checking

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: OpenFields2.java (auto-targeting and melee combat logic)
- **Focus Areas**: Character attack state transitions, auto-targeting loop logic
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Must not break existing manual melee combat functionality

### 2. Character Facing Direction During Auto-Targeting ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Facing Logic Analysis**
  - [ ] Identify where character facing direction is set during movement
  - [ ] Review auto-targeting movement and facing coordination
  - [ ] Analyze priority between movement direction and target facing
  - [ ] Test current behavior with various movement/attack scenarios

- [ ] **Facing Direction Correction**
  - [ ] Implement target-facing priority during auto-targeting attacks
  - [ ] Maintain proper facing when moving toward attack position
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (target behind character, rapid target changes)
  - [ ] Ensure smooth visual transitions in facing direction

**Design Specifications:**
- **Target Priority Facing**: Characters should ALWAYS face their target when auto-targeting, regardless of movement direction
- **Visual Consistency**: Smooth facing transitions that don't cause jarring visual effects
- **Combat Realism**: Characters maintain target awareness while repositioning
- **Movement Integration**: Facing changes should not interfere with movement pathfinding
- **No UI Indicators**: No visual indicators needed for auto-targeting state or current target

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: OpenFields2.java (character facing and auto-targeting logic)
- **Focus Areas**: Character rendering orientation, auto-targeting state management
- **Visual Impact**: Affects character sprite orientation during combat

### 3. Manual-to-Auto Targeting Transition Fix ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **State Transition Analysis**
  - [ ] Investigate auto-targeting activation state after manual attacks
  - [ ] Review weapon state compatibility between manual and auto modes
  - [ ] Analyze timing issues in transition from manual to auto targeting
  - [ ] Test various manual attack scenarios before auto-targeting activation

- [ ] **Transition State Management**
  - [ ] Fix auto-targeting activation (CTRL-SHIFT-T) to work after manual shots
  - [ ] Ensure weapon states are properly reset/compatible for auto-targeting
  - [ ] Handle incomplete manual attack sequences during transition
  - [ ] Implement automatic target switching using Euclidean distance to nearest enemy when current target invalid
  - [ ] Implement immediate target switching when targets become invalid
  - [ ] Use random selection for equidistant targets

**Design Specifications:**
- **Seamless Transition**: Auto-targeting (CTRL-SHIFT-T) should activate properly regardless of previous manual actions
- **State Reset**: Weapon and attack states should be properly initialized for auto-targeting
- **Target Switching**: When current target becomes invalid, immediately switch to nearest enemy using Euclidean distance
- **Target Selection**: Use random selection when multiple enemies are equidistant
- **Attack Completion**: Complete current attack if target becomes invalid during attack, then switch
- **Multi-Unit Support**: CTRL-SHIFT-T works with multiple selected units simultaneously
- **User Experience**: No confusing delays or non-responsiveness when switching modes

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: OpenFields2.java (auto-targeting activation and weapon state management), InputManager (CTRL-SHIFT-T handler)
- **Focus Areas**: Auto-targeting initialization, weapon state transitions, Euclidean distance target switching logic
- **Edge Cases**: Handle partial manual attacks, weapon state conflicts, equidistant target random selection
- **Research Required**: Auto-targeting state storage implementation in existing codebase

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Auto-Targeting + Melee Combat**: Auto-targeting must properly manage melee attack continuation and state transitions
- **Auto-Targeting + Character Movement**: Character facing must prioritize target orientation during auto-targeting movement
- **Manual Combat + Auto-Targeting**: Seamless transition between manual and automatic targeting modes
- **Event Queue Management**: Proper scheduling of continued attacks in auto-targeting mode

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Melee Auto-Targeting Fix**: Critical for basic auto-targeting functionality (highest priority)
2. **Character Facing Fix**: Important for visual consistency and realism (high priority)
3. **Manual-to-Auto Transition**: Important for user experience continuity (high priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Auto-targeting logic, character facing, state management, melee attack continuation

**Focus Areas:**
- Auto-targeting loop and continuation logic
- Character facing/orientation during combat
- State transition management between manual and auto modes
- Melee attack state cleanup and reset

### Data Flow
**Bug fix information flow:**
1. **Auto-Targeting Loop** → **Melee Attack State Check** → **Continue/Stop Decision**
2. **Movement Command** → **Target Check** → **Facing Direction Update**
3. **Manual Attack** → **Auto-Targeting Activation** → **State Validation** → **Target Acquisition**

### Performance Considerations
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal impact - bug fixes should not add significant computational overhead
- **Rendering Impact**: Character facing fixes may require additional orientation calculations
- **Memory Impact**: No significant memory usage changes expected
