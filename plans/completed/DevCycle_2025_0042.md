## Planning Questions for User Review

### Implementation Strategy Questions
EDNOTE: Go with Recommendations.

1. **Utility Package Creation**: Should the `com.openfields.testutils` package be created immediately in Phase 1, or should we prototype utilities in the existing test package structure first and refactor later?

   **Recommendation**: Create the `com.openfields.testutils` package immediately in Phase 1. This establishes clear boundaries from the start and avoids double refactoring. The package structure signals the utilities are shared infrastructure, not test-specific code.

2. **Existing Test Preservation**: During refactoring, should we maintain both the original and refactored versions of test classes temporarily (e.g., `HeadlessGunfightTest` and `HeadlessGunfightTestRefactored`) to ensure safe rollback?

   **Recommendation**: Use Git for version control rather than maintaining duplicate test classes. Create frequent commits during refactoring with clear messages. This avoids confusion from having two versions and relies on proven version control for rollback needs.

3. **Test Selection for Initial Refactoring**: Which 2-3 non-critical test classes should be chosen for initial refactoring in Phase 2? Should we prioritize the simplest tests or those with the most duplication?

   **Recommendation**: Prioritize tests with the most duplication first, specifically: `RandomControlTestAutomated`, `WinchesterTestAutomated`, and `MosinNagantTestAutomated`. These demonstrate maximum value quickly and aren't in the critical test set, making them ideal candidates.

### Technical Design Questions

4. **Static vs Instance Methods**: The plan proposes all utility methods as static. Should we consider any instance-based utilities for stateful test scenarios, or maintain pure static design throughout?

   **Recommendation**: Maintain pure static design for all utilities. Static methods are simpler, require no initialization, and match the stateless nature of test setup. If stateful scenarios emerge later, create separate builder classes rather than mixing paradigms.

5. **Exception Handling Strategy**: For ReflectionTestUtils, should reflection failures throw runtime exceptions, return Optional values, or use a custom error handling approach?

   **Recommendation**: Throw runtime exceptions with detailed error messages. Test utilities should fail fast and loud when something goes wrong. Include the class name, field/method name, and attempted operation in error messages for easy debugging.

6. **Naming Conventions**: Should test character factory methods use descriptive names like `createGunfighterAlpha()` or more generic names like `createTestCharacter1()` with configuration parameters?

   **Recommendation**: Use descriptive names like `createGunfighterAlpha()`. These self-document test intent and make test code more readable. Provide additional parameterized methods like `createCharacterWithStats()` for custom scenarios.

### Scope and Priority Questions

7. **Minimal Viable Product**: If time constraints arise, which systems could be deferred to a future DevCycle while still achieving meaningful code reduction? Is there a minimum set of utilities that would provide 40%+ value?

   **Recommendation**: Minimum viable set: TestGameSetup + ReflectionTestUtils + TestCharacterFactory. These three provide 40-50% value. Defer BaseTestClasses and TestDataManager as they're lower impact. TestAssertions can be partially implemented.

8. **Test Coverage for Utilities**: The plan mentions unit tests for utilities. Should these utility tests be comprehensive or focus only on critical paths to avoid "testing the tests" too deeply?

   **Recommendation**: Focus on critical paths only. Test error handling, edge cases, and complex logic (like reflection utilities). Skip testing simple delegations or straightforward factory methods. Aim for 70% coverage of utility code.

9. **Migration Documentation**: Should the migration guide be a separate document or integrated into each utility class's JavaDoc? How detailed should migration examples be?

   **Recommendation**: Create both. Add concise migration examples in JavaDoc for quick reference, and create a separate `TEST_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive before/after examples. Include 3-4 real migration examples per utility class.

### Integration and Compatibility Questions

10. **Gradual Adoption Strategy**: Should refactored tests coexist with non-refactored tests indefinitely, or should there be a target date for complete migration?

   **Recommendation**: Migrate tests as needed without specific timeline pressure. Focus on migrating tests when they require modifications anyway. Mandate utility usage for all new tests immediately.

11. **Backward Compatibility Duration**: How long should we maintain backward compatibility for teams/developers who might have local test modifications?

   **Recommendation**: No backward compatibility constraints needed. Refactor all tests to use utilities aggressively. This is the best time to modernize the entire test infrastructure.

12. **Critical Test Timing**: Should critical test refactoring wait until all utilities are proven stable, or can we refactor them incrementally as each utility is validated?

   **Recommendation**: Wait until all utilities are proven stable with non-critical tests. Only refactor critical tests after 2-3 non-critical tests successfully use each utility. This ensures zero risk to the critical test suite.

### Performance and Quality Questions

13. **Performance Benchmarking Tools**: What specific metrics and tools should be used for performance benchmarking? Is Maven Surefire reporting sufficient or do we need additional profiling?

   **Recommendation**: No performance benchmarking needed. Focus effort on functionality and maintainability. Simple before/after timing notes in completion summary are sufficient.

14. **Code Review Process**: Should there be peer review requirements for each utility class before it's used in test refactoring, or is self-validation sufficient?

   **Recommendation**: Self-validation is sufficient for this single-developer project. Focus on thorough testing and clear documentation instead. Run utilities through multiple test scenarios before widespread adoption.

15. **Success Metrics Validation**: How should we measure "50% faster new test creation" - by timing actual test development or by lines of code required?

   **Recommendation**: Measure by lines of code reduction in actual refactored tests. Count setup/teardown lines eliminated and duplication removed. Document specific before/after examples in the completion review.

### Future Planning Questions

16. **Utility Evolution**: Should these utilities be designed as a stable API from the start, or allow for breaking changes in early iterations based on usage feedback?

   **Recommendation**: Allow breaking changes for the first 2-3 months while gathering usage feedback. Mark utilities as "@Beta" in JavaDoc initially. After stabilization, treat as stable API with deprecation cycles for changes.

17. **Cross-Project Reusability**: Should these test utilities be designed for potential extraction into a separate test utility library for other projects?

   **Recommendation**: Design for OpenFields2 specifically now, but keep utilities loosely coupled to game code. Avoid OpenFields2-specific types in utility signatures where possible. This enables future extraction without current overhead.

18. **Documentation Standards**: Should utility documentation include anti-patterns and "what not to do" examples in addition to positive usage examples?

   **Recommendation**: Yes, include anti-patterns for complex utilities (especially ReflectionTestUtils and BaseTestClasses). Add a "Common Mistakes" section in JavaDoc for methods where misuse is likely. Keep it concise - one anti-pattern per utility class maximum.
