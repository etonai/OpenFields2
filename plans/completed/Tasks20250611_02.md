# Advanced Combat Mechanics Enhancement - TODO List
*Created: June 11, 2025 at 4:01 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 11, 2025 at 7:40 PM PDT | Implementation Update: June 11, 2025 at 8:35 PM PDT*

## 1. Enhanced Stray Shot System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Modify Danger Circle Mechanics**
  - [x] Change stray shot probability to 0.5% * number of people in danger circle (capped at 50%)
  - [x] Verify current danger circle calculation (range-based with min/max radius)
  - [x] Update stray shot calculation in `CombatResolver.java` or similar
  - [x] Remove fixed 15% base probability, replace with dynamic scaling
  - [x] Implement weighted random target selection (distance-based + prone modifier)
  - [x] Remove 30% damage reduction on stray shots (use full damage)
  - [x] Test with varying numbers of nearby characters (1, 5, 10+ targets)

**Design Specifications:**
- **Probability**: 0.5% per person in danger circle, maximum 50% chance
- **Danger Circle**: Range-based calculation with min/max radius (verify current implementation)  
- **Target Selection**: Weighted by distance from miss point + prone characters less likely
- **Hits**: One randomly selected target per missed shot
- **Damage**: Full damage (no reduction)

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Position System**: Standing (0.5%), Kneeling (0.25%), Prone (0.125%) contribution to stray shot probability
- **Hit Selection**: Standing (100%), Kneeling (50%), Prone (25%) relative hit likelihood when randomly selecting targets
- **Friendly Fire**: Allowed - stray shots can hit allies
- **Weapon Scope**: Ranged weapons only (no melee stray shots)
- **Shooter Immunity**: None - shooters can be hit by their own stray shots
- **Empty Circle**: No stray shot calculation when no valid targets in danger circle
- **Target Selection**: Random selection from valid targets (no distance weighting)
- **Position Transition Timing**: Anything→Prone (immediate), Standing→Kneeling (0.5s), Prone→Kneeling (1.0s), Kneeling→Standing (0.5s)
- **Position State Persistence**: All position states persist through save/load operations
- **Probability Calculation**: Sum of all character contributions (e.g., 5 standing + 3 kneeling + 2 prone = 3.5% total probability)
- **Incapacitated Characters**: Count toward stray shot probability using prone contribution (0.125%)
- **Two-Stage Process**: First roll for stray shot occurrence, then separate roll for target selection using hit weights
- **Moving Character States**: Use current position state for both probability calculation and hit selection
- **Self-Targeting**: Shooters can hit themselves with stray shots if they're the only character in danger circle
- **Uniform Position Selection**: When all characters have same position, hit selection becomes effectively random
- **Rapid Fire Independence**: Each successive miss gets independent stray shot calculations
- **Danger Circle Boundaries**: Uses existing code implementation (range-based with min/max radius)
- **Original Target Bravery**: Original intended targets still receive bravery checks for misses even when stray shots occur

## 2. Prone Combat System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add Prone Position State**
  - [x] Add `PRONE` to movement type or create new character state enum
  - [x] Implement prone position in `Character.java` class
  - [x] Add controls to enter/exit prone position (C/V keys)
  - [x] Display prone status in character UI

- [x] **Prone Movement Restrictions**
  - [x] Force prone characters to use CRAWL movement only
  - [x] Prevent walk/jog/run when in prone position
  - [x] Update movement system to respect prone limitations
  - [x] Add UI feedback when trying invalid movements

- [x] **Prone Combat Modifiers**
  - [x] Implement "harder to hit" modifier for prone targets (-15 accuracy)
  - [x] Research appropriate accuracy penalty for shooting at prone targets
  - [x] Add prone target modifier to hit calculation system
  - [x] Test prone vs standing combat scenarios

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Position States**: Standing, Kneeling, Prone (expand to three-position system)
- **Prone Accuracy Penalty**: -15 accuracy penalty when targeting prone characters
- **Position Transition Timing**: Anything→Prone (immediate), Standing→Kneeling (0.5s), Prone→Kneeling (1.0s), Kneeling→Standing (0.5s)
- **Auto-Prone**: Critical wounds and incapacitation cause instant prone (no timing delay)
- **Action Interruption**: Going prone interrupts all combat actions
- **Movement Cancellation**: Going prone while moving cancels movement
- **Terrain Independence**: Characters can go prone on any surface
- **Position Conflicts**: Attempting to go prone while already prone has no effect
- **Weapon Usage**: All weapons work normally when prone (future enhancement planned)
- **Position State Persistence**: All position states persist through save/load operations
- **Position State Storage**: Separate `PositionState currentPosition` field in Character.java, independent of MovementType
- **Position Controls**: Two keys for position changes - one to increase state (prone→kneeling→standing), one to decrease
- **Transition Interruption**: Critical wounds instantly cancel ongoing position transitions
- **Action Restart**: Going prone restarts active actions (reloading, etc.) from the beginning
- **Wound-Forced Timing**: Leg wounds cause instant prone transition (no timing delay)
- **Position Control Keys**: C key (crouch down: standing→kneeling→prone), V key (stand up: prone→kneeling→standing)
- **Incapacitation Transition**: Incapacitated characters always become prone (regardless of transition state)
- **Hesitation Position Queue**: Voluntary position changes are queued during hesitation and executed after hesitation ends
- **Kneeling Aiming Interruption**: Any position transition (including kneeling) interrupts very careful aiming
- **Action Restart Policy**: Any position change (kneeling or prone) restarts active actions from beginning

## 3. Bravery Check System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add Bravery Check Tracking**
  - [x] Add bravery check failure tracking (uses existing coolness stat)
  - [x] Add hesitation modifier tracking from failed bravery checks
  - [x] Add bravery check statistics (success/failure counts)

- [x] **Implement Bravery Check Mechanics**
  - [x] Trigger bravery check when wounded and when allies hit within 30 feet
  - [x] Implement independent check system with stacking penalties
  - [x] Add bravery check dice rolling mechanism
  - [x] Apply accuracy penalty (-10 per failure) for 3 seconds
  - [x] Create bravery check calculation method using coolness stat

- [x] **Integrate with Combat System**
  - [x] Hook bravery checks into projectile impact resolution
  - [x] Add bravery check messages to combat feedback
  - [x] Ensure bravery checks trigger for wounds and ally hits
  - [x] Test bravery system under sustained fire scenarios

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Check Formula**: 50% + (2 × coolness modifier) base success chance
- **Trigger Conditions**: Direct misses only (not stray shots), regardless of shooter faction
- **Independent Checks**: Each miss triggers its own independent bravery check (no escalating penalties)
- **Stat Usage**: Uses existing coolness stat (no separate bravery stat required)
- **Hesitation Stacking**: Bravery hesitation adds to wound hesitation (unlimited total duration)
- **Hesitation Conflicts**: Bravery hesitation and wound hesitation can stack simultaneously
- **Recovery**: No recovery mechanism initially (future enhancement planned)
- **Bravery Hesitation Duration**: Failed bravery checks cause 1 second of hesitation
- **Incapacitated Immunity**: Incapacitated characters do not require bravery checks for missed shots
- **Simultaneous Miss Processing**: Multiple projectile misses in same tick each trigger separate independent bravery checks
- **Very Careful Aiming Vulnerability**: Bravery check hesitation interrupts very careful aiming mode


## 4. Very Careful Aiming System ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Skill-Based Careful Aiming**
  - [x] Add skill level requirement (Level 1+ for very careful aiming)
  - [x] Implement skill level checking in aiming system
  - [x] Add very careful aiming option to aiming speed controls
  - [x] Display skill requirements in UI when unavailable

- [x] **Enhanced Aiming Mechanics**
  - [x] Add random additional aiming time calculation (2-5 seconds)
  - [x] Implement skill-level-based accuracy bonus scaling (double bonus)
  - [x] Extend existing aiming speed system with new "very careful" mode
  - [x] Balance timing vs accuracy bonus for different skill levels

- [x] **Integration with Existing Systems**
  - [x] Ensure very careful aiming works with pistol and rifle weapon types
  - [x] Update aiming UI to show very careful option when available
  - [x] Add timing feedback during extended aiming periods
  - [x] Test very careful aiming with different character skill levels

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Skill Requirements**: Weapon-specific skill level 1+ required (Pistol/Rifle skill)
- **Additional Aiming Time**: Random 2-5 seconds added to normal aiming (calculated fresh each attempt)
- **Accuracy Bonus**: Double the existing weapon skill bonus (+10 per level total)
- **Weapon Compatibility**: Pistol and Rifle weapons only (OTHER weapons not supported)
- **Aiming Speed Hierarchy**: Very Careful / Careful / Normal / Quick (four-tier system)
- **Skill Level 0 Handling**: Available but provides no accuracy benefit
- **Movement Restriction**: Can only use very careful aiming when stationary (not moving)
- **Mode Switching**: Normal→Very Careful restarts; Very Careful→Normal reduces remaining time by time already spent
- **Position Changes**: Going prone while very carefully aiming restarts the process
- **Interruption Handling**: Being shot at or wounded restarts very careful aiming
- **Auto-Weapon Behavior**: First bullet gets very careful bonus, successive bullets treated as quick aiming
- **Control Scheme**: Uses existing Q/E system (expanded to handle four-tier aiming speeds)
- **Weapon Skill Specificity**: Pistol skills only apply to pistols, rifle skills only to rifles (no cross-application to OTHER weapons)
- **Skill Level Changes**: Mid-aim skill level changes not considered in implementation
- **Position Independence**: Very careful aiming works in all position states (standing/kneeling/prone)

## 5. Movement Wound Penalties ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Wound Location Tracking Enhancement**
  - [x] Ensure wound system tracks specific body part hits (legs vs other)
  - [x] Add wound severity tracking per body part
  - [x] Implement wound counting by location (both legs, single leg, etc.)
  - [x] Update wound application to check movement impacts

- [x] **Movement Restriction Logic**
  - [x] Light leg wound: disable RUN movement (Walk/Jog/Crawl only)
  - [x] Both legs wounded: disable WALK and higher (Crawl only)
  - [x] Both legs serious wounds: force CRAWL only movement
  - [x] Add movement capability checking before allowing movement changes

- [x] **UI and Feedback Systems**
  - [x] Display movement restrictions in character status
  - [x] Show wound-based movement limitations in controls
  - [x] Add feedback messages when trying restricted movements
  - [x] Visual indicators for movement-impaired characters

**Design Specifications (Updated):**
- **Wound Definition**: Only LEFT_LEG/RIGHT_LEG body parts count as leg wounds
- **Wound Classification**: Uses existing WoundSeverity enum (LIGHT vs SERIOUS/CRITICAL)
- **Critical Wounds**: Count as "serious" for movement restrictions (though currently cause incapacitation)
- **Light Wound Effects**: Single light wound to one leg disables RUN movement
- **Both Legs Wounded**: Requires light or more serious wounds to both legs (not scratch wounds)
- **Stacking Rules**: 
  - Both legs wounded: Can only CRAWL and forced PRONE
  - Same leg multiple wounds: Disable RUN only
- **Movement Type Controls**: UI allows movement attempts; code enforces restrictions and adjusts to allowed type
- **Immediate Effects**: Instant movement deceleration and prone forcing when restrictions apply
- **Transition Priority**: Forced prone takes priority over ongoing position transitions
- **Combat Integration**: Movement restrictions affect speed of all combat actions
- **Healing**: Movement restrictions persist until wounds heal (future system)
- **Arm Wound Effects**: Already implemented - arm wounds affect accuracy via existing wound modifier system in CombatCalculator.java
- **Movement Speed Transition**: Forced movement speed changes happen immediately (no gradual stepping down)
- **Position Changes with Wounds**: Characters can attempt position changes, but those forced prone cannot stand or kneel
- **Transition Interruption**: Leg wounds forcing prone interrupt ongoing position transitions immediately
- **Mixed Wound Severity Priority**: Most serious wound severity determines movement restriction (Critical > Serious > Light > Scratch)

## 6. Wound Damage Tracking ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add Damage Field to Wound Class**
  - [x] Add `int damage` field to Wound constructor and class
  - [x] Update all Wound creation calls to include damage parameter
  - [x] Modify wound constructor signature to accept damage value
  - [x] Update wound display and debugging to show damage values

- [x] **Integrate Damage Tracking with Combat System**
  - [x] Pass actual damage dealt to Wound constructor in CombatResolver
  - [x] Ensure damage value matches the health subtraction amount
  - [x] Update wound creation in both direct hits and stray shot systems
  - [x] Verify damage tracking works with existing wound modifier calculations

- [x] **Update Save/Load System**
  - [x] Add damage field to wound serialization/deserialization (backwards compatible)
  - [x] Ensure saved wounds preserve damage information
  - [x] Update save file format to include wound damage data
  - [x] Test save/load compatibility with damage-enhanced wounds

- [x] **Replace getDamageFromSeverity() with Actual Damage Tracking**
  - [x] Add `getDamage()` method to Wound class to return actual damage value
  - [x] Update `calculateWoundModifier()` to use `wound.getDamage()` instead of `getDamageFromSeverity(severity)`
  - [x] Replace head wound modifier calculation with `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty
  - [x] Replace shooting arm wound modifier calculation with `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty
  - [x] Replace critical wound modifier calculation with `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty
  - [x] Update `getWoundModifierDebugInfo()` to display actual damage values instead of estimates
  - [x] Remove obsolete `getDamageFromSeverity()` method once all references are replaced
  - [x] Test wound modifier calculations with various weapon damage values

**Design Specifications:**
- **Damage Field**: Add `int damage` field to Wound class to track actual damage dealt
- **Constructor Update**: Wound constructor signature becomes `Wound(BodyPart bodyPart, WoundSeverity severity, String weaponName, String weaponId, int damage)`
- **Damage Source**: Use the exact damage amount subtracted from character health when wound is inflicted
- **Consistency**: Damage value must match the health reduction applied to the character
- **Display Integration**: Include damage information in wound descriptions and character stats
- **Save Compatibility**: Delete existing save games (no backwards compatibility required)
- **Multiple Wounds Priority**: Individual wounds track their own damage; highest damage wound takes priority for movement restrictions
- **Damage Value Storage**: Store multiplied damage (including headshot multipliers) that was actually subtracted from health
- **Wound Display Format**: "BODYPART SEVERITY: X damage" format (e.g., "HEAD SERIOUS: 12 damage")
- **Constructor Migration**: Standard migration expected (no special parameter order concerns)

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
The current `getDamageFromSeverity()` method in CombatCalculator.java uses hardcoded damage estimates based only on wound severity:
- SCRATCH: 1 damage
- LIGHT: 3 damage  
- SERIOUS: 8 damage
- CRITICAL: 8 damage

This method is used in `calculateWoundModifier()` for:
- **Head wounds**: -1 accuracy per damage point (uses `getDamageFromSeverity()`)
- **Shooting arm wounds**: -1 accuracy per damage point (uses `getDamageFromSeverity()`)
- **Critical wounds to other body parts**: -1 accuracy per damage point (uses `getDamageFromSeverity()`)
- **Other body parts**: Fixed penalties (-1 for light, -2 for serious, uses `getDamageFromSeverity()` for critical)

**Proposed Replacement:**
1. **Add `getDamage()` method to Wound class** to return the actual damage value
2. **Replace all `getDamageFromSeverity(severity)` calls** with `wound.getDamage()` in wound modifier calculations
3. **Update wound modifier logic** to use actual damage consistently:
   - Head wounds: `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty
   - Shooting arm wounds: `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty  
   - Critical wounds to other parts: `-wound.getDamage()` accuracy penalty
   - Light/Serious other parts: Keep existing fixed penalties (-1/-2) or switch to damage-based
4. **Update debug output** to show actual damage values instead of estimated ones
5. **Remove `getDamageFromSeverity()` method** once all references are replaced

**Benefits:**
- Accurate wound modifiers based on actual weapon damage dealt
- Consistency between wound effects and the damage that created them
- Better scaling with different weapon damage values
- More realistic wound impact representation

## System Interaction Specifications
**Implementation guidelines for when multiple systems interact:**

- **Multi-State Handling**: No conflicts - leg wounds force prone, hesitations affect other movements independently
- **Save Format**: Update required for new character states (prone, bravery counters, wound restrictions)
- **Save Compatibility**: Delete existing save games (no backwards compatibility)
- **AI Integration**: These systems will not affect AI behavior initially
- **Performance**: Monitor for optimization needs after implementation
- **Event Priority**: Wounds → Prone changes → Bravery checks (in that order)
- **UI Display**: Current system uses '?' for full stats; add future task for abbreviated status when selected

**System Integration Specifications:**
- **Hesitation Duration**: No maximum total hesitation time (wound + bravery hesitation stack additively)
- **Save Data Storage**: Position states stored with unit data, wound restrictions stored with character data
- **Hesitation Controls**: Position changes during hesitation are queued and executed after hesitation ends
- **Complex Event Ordering**: Multi-shot scenarios handled case-by-case (hit causing wound + miss causing bravery check assumed simultaneous)
- **Wound + Hesitation Interaction**: Leg wounds forcing prone execute immediately, hesitation continues concurrently
- **Mid-Transition Save/Load**: Game state and event queue saved to preserve transition continuity
- **Multi-Status UI**: Wounds and position states shown in '?' display, hesitation status added to future tasks
- **Event Queue Performance**: Performance concerns acknowledged, optimization deferred until problems arise
- **System Priority Order**: Forced prone (wounds/incapacitation) > Hesitations > Player input (highest to lowest priority)
