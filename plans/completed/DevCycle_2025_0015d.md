# InputManager Workflow Component Extraction - DevCycle 2025_0015d
*Created: June 21, 2025 | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
Continue the incremental refactoring of InputManager by extracting high-level workflow components. Building on the success of DevCycle 15c (InputEventRouter and InputStateTracker), this cycle focuses on extracting complex workflow management components that handle multi-step user interactions.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Extract EditModeManager for character creation workflows
- Extract GameStateManager for save/load and scenario operations  
- Extract CombatCommandProcessor for combat-specific input handling
- Establish proven workflow component architecture patterns
- Continue 100% backward compatibility while reducing InputManager complexity

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15c completed (InputEventRouter and InputStateTracker operational)
- All functionality validated via DevCycle 15b testing framework
- Zero tolerance for regressions using proven incremental methodology

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Well-defined workflow boundaries with clear separation

## Component Integration Architecture

### Integration Patterns
**InputManager as Workflow Coordinator:**
```java
InputManager (Coordinator)
    ├── eventRouter.routeEvent() → determines workflow component
    ├── editModeManager.handleEditWorkflow() → character creation
    ├── gameStateManager.handleStateWorkflow() → save/load operations
    ├── combatCommandProcessor.handleCombatWorkflow() → combat commands
    └── stateTracker.updateState() → workflow state management
```

### Communication Flow
1. **Event Reception**: InputManager receives input event
2. **Event Routing**: InputEventRouter determines appropriate workflow component
3. **Workflow Processing**: Appropriate component handles workflow logic
4. **State Management**: InputStateTracker manages workflow state transitions
5. **Callback Execution**: InputManager coordinates callbacks to game systems

### Component Dependencies
- **EditModeManager** depends on: InputStateTracker, character creation systems
- **GameStateManager** depends on: InputStateTracker, SaveGameManager, game persistence
- **CombatCommandProcessor** depends on: InputStateTracker, combat systems, targeting
- **All Components** integrate with: InputEventRouter for routing decisions

## DevCycle 15d Planning Questions for User Review

### Component Priority Questions
1. Should we prioritize EditModeManager first (character creation workflows) or GameStateManager (save/load operations)?
2. Do you want all three components (Edit, GameState, Combat) in this cycle, or focus on fewer components for deeper testing?
3. Are there other workflow areas you'd prefer to extract instead of or in addition to these three?

### Implementation Approach Questions
4. Should we extract complete workflows at once, or break them into sub-components (e.g., separate CharacterCreation from BatchOperations)?
5. Do you want component communication to go through InputManager coordination, or allow direct component-to-component interaction?
6. Should we implement workflow state persistence for complex multi-step processes?

### Testing and Validation Questions
7. Should we apply the full DevCycle 15b testing suite after each component extraction, or batch testing after all extractions?
8. Do you want automated workflow testing, or continue with the manual testing approach established in DevCycle 15b?
9. Should we establish performance benchmarks for workflow processing efficiency?

### Architecture Questions
10. Do you want workflow components to be stateful (maintaining workflow state) or stateless (delegating to InputStateTracker)?
11. Should we create a common WorkflowComponent interface/base class for consistency?
12. How detailed should the workflow state machines be - simple state tracking or complex workflow orchestration?

### Integration Questions
13. Should extracted components have direct access to game systems, or go through InputManager coordination?
14. Do you want workflow components to handle their own error recovery, or delegate error handling to InputManager?
15. Should we maintain the existing callback interfaces exactly, or allow for improved callback designs within the new components?
