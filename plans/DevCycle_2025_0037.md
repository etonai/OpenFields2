# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0037
*Created: 2025-07-02 at [Time] | Last Design Update: [Date] at [Time] | Last Implementation Update: [Date] at [Time] | Implementation Status: Ready for System 1 Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on implementing multiple varied tasks to improve system stability, fix critical bugs, and enhance game mechanics. The cycle will address several independent issues and improvements identified through testing and analysis.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **⚠️ CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Update CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development cycle tracking and plan document location information
- Implement additional system improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 36 successfully completed and merged
- All existing tests passing
- Clean working directory

**Estimated Complexity:** Low - Documentation update with file analysis and structured information organization

## System Implementations

- [ ] **Development Cycle Status Tracking**
  - [ ] Add section documenting last completed cycle (DevCycle 36)
  - [ ] Add section for current active cycle tracking
  - [ ] Include cycle completion dates and status indicators
  - [ ] Document cycle numbering system and naming conventions

- [ ] **Plan Document Location Registry**
  - [ ] Document current/active plan document locations in `plans/` directory
  - [ ] Document completed plan document locations in `plans/completed/` directory 
  - [ ] Document plan template locations in `plans/` directory
  - [ ] Include template naming conventions and usage guidelines

- [ ] **Workflow Process Enhancement**
  - [ ] Update DevCycle_workflow_plan.md to include CLAUDE.md update steps in cycle closure
  - [ ] Add plan document archiving steps to workflow for moving documents to completed directory
  - [ ] Define system completion procedures within cycles (documentation updates and commits)
  - [ ] Integrate CLAUDE.md maintenance into standard workflow processes

**Design Specifications:**
- **Last Completed Cycle Tracking**: CLAUDE.md must indicate DevCycle 36 as the most recently completed cycle with completion date
- **Current Cycle Awareness**: CLAUDE.md must indicate DevCycle 37 as the currently active cycle
- **Document Location Mapping**: Complete directory structure documentation for all plan-related files
- **Template Documentation**: Clear guidance on available templates and their purposes

- **Workflow Integration**: DevCycle_workflow_plan.md must include CLAUDE.md updates in cycle closure procedures
- **Document Archiving Process**: Clear steps for moving plan documents to completed directory during cycle closure
- **System Completion Protocol**: Standardized steps for marking systems complete within cycles (documentation updates and commits)

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - `/mnt/c/dev/TTCombat/OF2Prototype01/CLAUDE.md` - Add cycle tracking and document location sections
  - `/mnt/c/dev/TTCombat/OF2Prototype01/plans/DevCycle_workflow_plan.md` - Add workflow enhancements for cycle closure and system completion
- **New Sections to Add**: 
  - "Development Cycle Tracking" section in CLAUDE.md

  - "CLAUDE.md Update Steps" in cycle closure workflow
  - "Plan Document Archiving" procedures in workflow
  - "System Completion Protocol" steps in workflow
- **Information Sources**: Analyze `plans/` directory structure and `plans/completed/` directory contents
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain all existing content while adding new tracking and workflow sections

### 2. [Next System] ⭕ **TBD**
*To be determined after System 1 is complete and tested. DO NOT plan this section until System 1 is finished.*

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️**
**DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION TO THIS SECTION UNTIL SYSTEM 1 IS COMPLETE**
- No system names or descriptions
- No implementation tasks or components
- No design specifications
- No technical notes
- This section exists only as a placeholder for future planning

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

*Note: This section will be updated as each system is completed and interactions are discovered.*

- **System 1 + Existing Systems**: CLAUDE.md documentation update has no direct system integration dependencies
- **Event Queue Management**: No event queue impact for documentation updates

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **System 1**: Documentation enhancement with no code integration required (highest priority)
2. **Future Systems**: Priority determined after System 1 completion

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**

## 🔄 CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ✅ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ❌ **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ✅ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ⭕ **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- 🚫 **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ✅ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

## ⚠️ ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ⚠️

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

---

*This iterative development cycle focuses on implementing one system at a time while maintaining flexibility for additional improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*
