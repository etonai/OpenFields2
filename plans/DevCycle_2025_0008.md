*Created: June 14, 2025 06:56 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 14, 2025 08:20 PM PDT | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on establishing a robust character management foundation for OpenFields2. The primary objective is to create persistent character storage and deployment systems that will enable large-scale scenario development in future cycles.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement character creation and deployment workflow (CTRL-C/CTRL-A)
- Create persistent character storage system using faction files containing faction data and character rosters
- Redesign faction system with proper Faction class (ID, name, allies, enemies, color)
- Add unit deletion capability (DEL key with confirmation)
- Enable character statistics tracking across battle sessions

**Prerequisites:** 
- Existing character creation system in edit mode
- Current save/load framework
- Character statistics tracking from DevCycle 7

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Clear interfaces but requires new file management and UI integration

- [ ] **CTRL-A Character Deployment Interface**
  - [ ] Implement new CTRL-A keyboard handler with multi-step workflow
  - [ ] Prompt for number of characters to deploy
  - [ ] Prompt for faction selection from available factions
  - [ ] Request click location for first unit placement (re-prompt if outside map bounds)
  - [ ] Prompt for formation direction (line right vs line down)
  - [ ] Prompt for unit spacing in feet between characters
  - [ ] Prompt for weapon selection for all deployed characters
  - [ ] Load faction data and filter non-incapacitated characters from selected faction file
  - [ ] Validate sufficient characters available before deployment
  - [ ] Position characters in formation with specified spacing
  - [ ] Arm deployed characters with selected weapon type
  - [ ] Provide error feedback if insufficient characters available

- [ ] **DEL Key Unit Deletion**
  - [ ] Implement DEL key handler for selected units
  - [ ] Add confirmation dialog for unit deletion
  - [ ] Remove unit from current scenario only (preserve faction character files)
  - [ ] Handle edge cases for units in combat or with scheduled events
  - [ ] Provide visual feedback for successful deletion

**Design Specifications:**
- **Character Creation Flow**: CTRL-C → Quantity prompt → Existing archetype menu → Batch creation → Save to faction file in characters/ directory
- **Character Deployment Flow**: CTRL-A → Quantity prompt → Faction selection → Click placement → Formation direction → Spacing → Weapon selection → Deploy formation → Weapon assignment
- **Unit Deletion Flow**: Select unit → DEL key → Confirmation dialog → Remove from scenario (faction files unchanged)
- **Formation System**: Line formations (right/down) with configurable spacing in feet using 7 pixels = 1 foot conversion
- **Character Filtering**: Only deploy non-incapacitated characters from faction files
- **File Organization**: factions/ directory with faction files (0.json, 1.json, 2.json, 3.json) containing faction data and character rosters
- **User Interface**: Sequential prompts for deployment workflow, formation positioning system
- **Performance Requirements**: Handle formation placement of 20+ characters efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Validation for sufficient characters, faction availability, formation placement bounds

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `InputManager.java`, existing archetype menu code, `Character.java`, unit management code
- **New Classes/Enums**: `CharacterSelectionDialog.java`, `CharacterPersistenceManager.java`
- **Database/Save Changes**: New factions/ directory with faction files containing faction data and character rosters
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Independent of existing save system, no compatibility concerns

**Implementation Decisions:**
1. **Character Creation Edge Cases**: Create a new faction file if faction doesn't exist
2. **Deployment Validation**: Display error message and abort deployment if insufficient characters
3. **Weapon Assignment**: Prompt player to select weapon type for all deployed characters
4. **Formation Boundaries**: Allow placement outside canvas bounds (playable area is larger)
5. **Placement Validation**: Re-prompt for click location if player clicks outside map bounds
6. **File Corruption Handling**: Deferred to future development cycle

- **Faction Relationships**: Automatic neutral status for factions not in allies or enemies lists
- **Battle Statistics**: Track faction-level victories, defeats, and participations across all scenarios
- **File Storage**: factions/ directory with {factionId}.json files containing faction data and character rosters
- **Faction IDs**: Integer-based (0=NONE, 1=Union, 2=Confederacy, 3=Southern Unionists)

**Default Faction Definitions:**
- **NONE (ID: 0)**: No faction affiliation, no allies, no enemies, gray color, 0 victories/defeats/participations
- **Union (ID: 1)**: Union Army, allies with Southern Unionists (3), enemies with Confederacy (2), blue color, 0 victories/defeats/participations
- **Confederacy (ID: 2)**: Confederate States, no allies, enemies with Union (1) and Southern Unionists (3), dark gray color, 0 victories/defeats/participations

5. **Version Compatibility**: How do you handle version compatibility if the faction file format changes in future updates?
6. **Backup Strategy**: What's the backup/recovery strategy for faction files to prevent data loss?

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`InputManager.java`** - Add CTRL-C and CTRL-A keyboard handlers
- **`Character.java`** - Add serialization support for character persistence
- **`GameRenderer.java`** - Add UI dialogs for character creation/selection

**New Components Required:**
- **CharacterPersistenceManager**: Handles faction file operations
- **Faction**: Core faction class with properties and relationship methods
- **FactionRegistry**: Management system for all factions
- **CharacterSelectionDialog**: UI for character deployment selection
- **BattleResultsDialog**: UI for victory outcome selection per faction
- **VictoryOutcome**: Enum for victory/defeat/participant outcomes
- **CharacterData**: Serializable data structure for JSON storage

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Application Start** → **Load Factions** → **Initialize FactionRegistry** → **Ready for Character Operations**
2. **CTRL-C Press** → **Quantity Input** → **Archetype Selection** → **Faction Assignment** → **Batch Character Creation** → **Save to Faction File**
3. **CTRL-A Press** → **Quantity Input** → **Faction Selection** → **Click Placement** → **Formation Direction** → **Spacing Input** → **Weapon Selection** → **Load Non-Incapacitated Characters** → **Formation Deployment** → **Weapon Assignment**
4. **DEL Key Press** → **Confirmation Dialog** → **Remove Unit from Scenario** (faction files unchanged)
5. **CTRL-SHIFT-V Press** → **Identify Scenario Factions** → **Outcome Selection per Faction** → **Update All Character Victory Counts** → **Update Faction Statistics** → **Save Faction Files** → **End Scenario**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - character data loaded on demand
- **CPU Usage**: Low - simple JSON operations
- **Rendering Impact**: UI dialogs only, no continuous rendering overhead
- **File I/O**: Efficient JSON parsing for character data

**Performance Questions Requiring Analysis:**
1. **Large Character Rosters**: How do faction files perform with 100+ characters per faction?
2. **Frequent Updates**: What's the performance impact of frequent faction file updates during active battles?
3. **Memory Scaling**: At what point do loaded faction files become a memory concern?
4. **Concurrent Operations**: How do multiple simultaneous faction file operations affect performance?
5. **File Size Growth**: How large can faction files become before causing performance issues?
6. **Load Time Impact**: How do large faction files affect application startup time?
