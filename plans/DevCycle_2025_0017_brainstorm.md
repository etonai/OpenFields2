*Created: June 22, 2025*
*Converted from DevCycle_2025_future_005_brainstorm.md*

## **DevCycle 17 - Combat System Architecture & UI Integration**
**Focus**: Combat system data architecture improvements and user interface enhancements

## **Core Problem Statement**

Following the resolution of critical combat math issues in DevCycle 11 and the iterative UI improvements in DevCycle 16, several enhancement opportunities and architectural improvements have been identified. These systems build upon the foundation fixes and add new functionality to improve maintainability, user experience, and system integration.

## **Enhancement Systems Identified**

### **1. Weapon ID System Cleanup** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem Description:**
`findWeaponId()` method in `CombatResolver.java` is a crude string-matching approach with hardcoded weapon name mappings. The weapon ID should already be stored in the weapon object from JSON loading.

**Current Implementation Issues:**
```java
// CombatResolver.java lines 344-373 - 30 lines of hardcoded mappings
private String findWeaponId(Weapon weapon) {
    if (weapon.name.equals("Colt Peacemaker")) return "wpn_colt_peacemaker";
    if (weapon.name.equals("Hunting Rifle")) return "wpn_hunting_rifle";
    // ... 20+ more hardcoded mappings
    return "wpn_colt_peacemaker"; // fallback
}
```

**Problems Created:**
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: Every new weapon requires code changes
- **Error Prone**: Easy to forget to add new weapons
- **Data Redundancy**: ID already exists in JSON but not utilized
- **Brittle**: Name changes break ID lookup

**Solution:**
Add `weaponId` field to base `Weapon` class and populate from JSON during weapon creation.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `weaponId` field to `Weapon.java`
2. Update `WeaponFactory.java` and `MeleeWeaponFactory.java` to set ID
3. Replace all `findWeaponId()` calls with `weapon.getWeaponId()`
4. Remove `findWeaponId()` method entirely

**Files Affected:**
- `Weapon.java` - Add field and getter
- `WeaponFactory.java` - Set ID during creation
- `MeleeWeaponFactory.java` - Set ID during creation  
- `CombatResolver.java` - Remove method, update callers
- `OpenFields2.java` - Update weapon ID usage
- `SaveGameController.java` - Update weapon ID usage

**Implementation Complexity**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (improves maintainability)

### **2. Skill-Weapon Integration Gap** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem Description:**
Each weapon in JSON files should indicate which skill applies to combat calculations, but this connection is currently missing. The skill system exists but isn't automatically integrated with combat.

**Current Skill System:**
- Skills: Pistol, Rifle, Quickdraw, Medicine, Unarmed, Knife, Sabre, Tomahawk
- Skills provide +5 accuracy per level for ranged weapons
- Melee weapons don't automatically apply skill bonuses

**Missing Integration:**
- Weapons don't specify their associated skill in JSON
- Combat system doesn't automatically look up and apply skill bonuses
- Manual skill checking required in combat calculations

**Proposed Solution:**
Add `combatSkill` field to weapon JSON files:

```json
// Ranged weapon example
{
  "id": "wpn_colt_peacemaker",
  "name": "Colt Peacemaker",
  "combatSkill": "Pistol",
  // ... other fields
}

// Melee weapon example  
{
  "id": "mel_steel_dagger",
  "name": "Steel Dagger", 
  "combatSkill": "Knife",
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `combatSkill` field to `WeaponData.java` and `MeleeWeaponData.java`
2. Update all JSON weapon files with appropriate skill mappings
3. Modify combat calculations to automatically apply skill bonuses
4. Update weapon factories to load skill information

**Skill Mappings:**
- **Pistol Weapons**: "Pistol" skill
- **Rifle Weapons**: "Rifle" skill
- **Knife/Dagger Weapons**: "Knife" skill
- **Sword/Sabre Weapons**: "Sabre" skill
- **Axe/Tomahawk Weapons**: "Tomahawk" skill
- **Unarmed Combat**: "Unarmed" skill

**Implementation Complexity**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (enables automatic skill integration)

### **3. Terminology Improvement: projectileName â†’ woundDescription** ðŸŸ¢ **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem Description:**
The term "projectileName" doesn't make semantic sense for melee weapons. A sword doesn't fire a "projectile" - it creates a wound with a specific description.

**Current Usage:**
- Ranged weapons: "9mm round", "bullet", "arrow"
- Melee weapons: "dagger strike", "sword slash", "axe blow"

**Proposed Change:**
Rename `projectileName` to `woundDescription` throughout the system.

**Affected Areas:**
- JSON weapon files (both ranged and melee)
- `WeaponData.java` and `MeleeWeaponData.java`
- `Weapon.java` base class
- Combat message generation
- Wound tracking system

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update base `Weapon` class field name
2. Update JSON field names in all weapon files
3. Update data loading classes  
4. Update combat message generation
5. Update wound tracking references

**Semantic Improvement:**
- Better represents what the field actually contains
- Makes more sense for melee weapons
- Clarifies purpose for new developers

**Implementation Complexity**: Low (mostly renaming)
**Impact**: Low (improves code clarity)

---

### **4. Character Stats Display Gaps** ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem Description:**
Melee weapons are not properly represented in the character statistics displays, creating inconsistent user experience between ranged and melee combat modes.

**Missing Display Elements:**
- **Character Stats (Shift+/)**: No melee weapon information shown
- **Quick Stats (Unit Selection)**: No melee weapon displayed
- **Combat Mode Indication**: Unclear which weapon is active

**Current Display Issues:**
- Users can't see melee weapon stats
- No indication of melee weapon damage/accuracy
- Switching to melee mode provides no visual feedback in stats
- Inconsistent with ranged weapon display

**Proposed Solution:**
Enhance character stats display to show both weapon types and indicate active mode.

**Enhanced Display Format:**
```
=== CHARACTER STATS ===
Name: Alice (Faction 1)
Combat Mode: MELEE
Active Weapon: Steel Dagger (6 damage, 15 accuracy)

Ranged Weapon: Colt Peacemaker (6 damage, 0 accuracy)
Melee Weapon: Steel Dagger (6 damage, 15 accuracy, 5.5ft reach)

Health: 14/14  Dexterity: 75 (+10)
Strength: 60 (+5)  Reflexes: 80 (+15)
```

**Implementation Areas:**
- `InputManager.java` - Character stats display logic
- Add melee weapon information to stats output  
- Show active combat mode
- Display weapon-specific stats (reach for melee, range for ranged)

**Implementation Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Impact**: High (improves user experience significantly)

---

### **5. Combat Experience Tracking Enhancement** ðŸŸ¢ **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem Description:**
Character combat experience tracking doesn't differentiate between melee attacks and ranged attacks, providing less detailed combat history and analytics.

**Current Tracking System:**
```java
// Character.java - Combined tracking
public int attacksAttempted = 0;
public int attacksSuccessful = 0;  
public int woundsInflictedScratch = 0;
// ... other wound types
```

**Enhancement Proposal:**
Add separate tracking for melee vs ranged combat actions.

**Enhanced Tracking System:**
```java
// Ranged combat statistics
public int rangedAttacksAttempted = 0;
public int rangedAttacksSuccessful = 0;
public int rangedWoundsInflicted = 0;

// Melee combat statistics  
public int meleeAttacksAttempted = 0;
public int meleeAttacksSuccessful = 0;
public int meleeWoundsInflicted = 0;

// Combined totals (for backwards compatibility)
public int getTotalAttacksAttempted() { 
    return rangedAttacksAttempted + meleeAttacksAttempted; 
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Better combat analytics and character development
- Supports future skill training based on combat type
- Provides more detailed battle reports
- Enables combat type specialization tracking

**Implementation Complexity**: Low
**Impact**: Low (nice-to-have enhancement)
