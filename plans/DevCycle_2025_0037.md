# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0037
*Created: 2025-07-02 at 2:59 PM PDT | Last Design Update: 2025-07-02 at 2:59 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: [Date] at [Time] | Implementation Status: Ready for System 1 Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on implementing multiple varied tasks to improve system stability, fix critical bugs, and enhance game mechanics. The cycle will address several independent issues and improvements identified through testing and analysis.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **⚠️ CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Update CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development cycle tracking and plan document location information
- Implement additional system improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 36 successfully completed and merged
- All existing tests passing
- Clean working directory

**Estimated Complexity:** Low - Documentation update with file analysis and structured information organization

## System Implementations

### 1. CLAUDE.md Development Cycle Tracking Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETE**

  - [x] Add section for current active cycle tracking
  - [x] Include cycle completion dates and status indicators
  - [x] Document cycle numbering system and naming conventions

- [x] **Plan Document Location Registry**

### 2. Target Switch Delay After Incapacitation ⭕ **PLANNED**
*Implement a reflexes-modified delay when characters switch targets after incapacitating an opponent in auto-targeting mode.*

- [ ] **Target Incapacitation Detection**
  - [ ] Identify when a character's current target becomes incapacitated
  - [ ] Detect when auto-targeting system needs to switch to next target
  - [ ] Distinguish between manual target switching vs. incapacitation-triggered switching
  - [ ] Integration with existing CombatCoordinator target management

- [ ] **Reflexes-Modified Delay Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement base 15-tick delay for target switching after incapacitation
  - [ ] Apply reflexes stat modifier to delay calculation (similar to weapon readying speed)
  - [ ] Calculate final delay: base delay × reflexes speed multiplier
  - [ ] Ensure delay only applies to incapacitation-triggered target switches, not manual switches

**Design Specifications:**
- **Base Delay Duration**: 15 ticks (0.25 seconds at 60 ticks/second) when switching targets after incapacitation
- **Reflexes Integration**: Use existing reflexes stat modifier system (similar to weapon readying speed calculation)
- **Delay Formula**: `targetSwitchDelay = 15 ticks × reflexesSpeedMultiplier`
- **Scope Limitation**: Only applies to auto-targeting when current target becomes incapacitated
- **Combat Realism**: Simulates time needed to process target down, scan for next target, and re-acquire
- **User Experience**: Prevents unrealistic instant target switching while maintaining responsive combat

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - `combat/AutoTargetingSystem.java` - Add incapacitation detection and delay logic
  - `combat/CombatCoordinator.java` - Integration with target switching logic
  - `combat/Character.java` - Access to reflexes stat for delay calculation
- **New Components Required**:
  - **Incapacitation Event Detection**: Monitor target health state changes
  - **Target Switch Delay Manager**: Handle timing and reflexes calculation
  - **Auto-Targeting State Management**: Track when delay is active vs. ready to switch
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Existing reflexes stat modifier system
  - Current auto-targeting implementation
  - CombatCoordinator target management
  - ScheduledEvent system for delay timing
- **Backwards Compatibility**: No impact on manual target switching or non-auto-targeting combat

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

*Note: This section will be updated as each system is completed and interactions are discovered.*

- **System 1 + Existing Systems**: CLAUDE.md documentation update has no direct system integration dependencies
- **System 2 + Auto-Targeting System**: Target switch delay integrates with existing auto-targeting without disrupting manual targeting
- **System 2 + Reflexes Stat System**: Reuses existing reflexes modifier calculation from weapon readying speed system
- **Event Queue Management**: System 2 uses ScheduledEvent system for target switch delay timing

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **System 1**: Documentation enhancement with no code integration required ✅ **COMPLETE**
2. **System 2**: Combat behavior enhancement requiring auto-targeting and reflexes system integration (current priority)
3. **Future Systems**: Priority determined after System 2 completion

```

### Commit Message Format
- **Format**: `DC-37: [Brief description]`

  - `DC-37: [Example will be added when System 1 is identified]`
  - `DC-37: [Example will be added when System 1 is identified]`

mvn test -Dtest=[TestName]     # Run specific test
```

## 🔄 CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ✅ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ❌ **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ✅ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ⭕ **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- 🚫 **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ✅ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

---

## ⚠️ ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ⚠️

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

---

*This iterative development cycle focuses on implementing one system at a time while maintaining flexibility for additional improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*
