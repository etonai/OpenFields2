# Area Fire Systems Implementation - TODO List
*Created: June 11, 2025 at 4:55 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 11, 2025 at 4:55 PM PDT*

## 4. Area Fire Systems
- [ ] **Burst Area Fire Implementation**
  - [ ] Create area selection UI (draw box mechanism)
  - [ ] Implement target enumeration within selected area
  - [ ] Add burst fire sequencing (minimal aim → fire → next target)
  - [ ] Apply "minimal aiming" accuracy penalties
  - [ ] Calculate burst fire timing and ammunition consumption
  - [ ] Add burst area fire to firing mode system

- [ ] **Full Auto Area Fire Design**
  - [ ] Research and design game advantages for full auto area fire
  - [ ] Consider: suppression effects, area denial, multiple simultaneous hits
  - [ ] Implement similar area selection to burst fire
  - [ ] Design full auto timing, accuracy, and ammo consumption
  - [ ] Add full auto area fire controls and UI

- [ ] **Area Fire UI and Controls**
  - [ ] Add area selection tool (click and drag box)
  - [ ] Visual feedback for selected area and targets within
  - [ ] Key bindings for burst/full auto area fire modes
  - [ ] Target priority ordering within selected area

**Design Questions:**
1. **Minimal Aiming Penalty**: What accuracy penalty should burst area fire have compared to normal aimed shots?
- The first shot has whatever penalty normally applies in that situation. But successive shots all have the same accuracy as if the character was using quick aiming speed 
2. **Full Auto Advantages**: What specific game advantages should full auto area fire provide? (suppression, area denial, fear effects?)
- Lets talk about this separately. The hesitation system should be involved.
3. **Target Priority**: How should targets be prioritized within the selected area? (closest first, left-to-right, user-defined order?)
- 
4. **Area Size Limits**: Should there be minimum/maximum area sizes for area fire modes?
- 
5. **Ammo Consumption**: How much ammo should each area fire mode consume per target vs. per area?
- This is in real time, it follows the rate of fire. For a weapon like an uzi, that means 10 shots in a second. Every bullet is calculated. Area fire just means that the shooter is limiting targets to that area.

## Testing & Integration
- [ ] **Area Fire Testing**
  - [ ] Test area selection UI with various box sizes
  - [ ] Validate burst fire sequencing with multiple targets
  - [ ] Test full auto area fire mechanics
  - [ ] Verify ammunition consumption accuracy

- [ ] **Performance and Stability**
  - [ ] Run `mvn compile` to ensure no compilation errors
  - [ ] Run `mvn test` to ensure existing functionality preserved
  - [ ] Test area fire systems don't impact game performance

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Key Files to Modify:**
  - `InputManager.java` - Area selection controls and UI
  - `GameRenderer.java` - Visual feedback for area selection
  - `CombatResolver.java` - Area fire targeting and execution
  - Firing mode system files - Integration with existing burst/auto modes

- **New Classes/Systems Needed:**
  - Area selection tool and UI components
  - Target enumeration within selected areas
  - Area fire execution sequencing

- **Balance Considerations:**
  - Area fire ammunition consumption vs effectiveness
  - Accuracy penalties for rapid area engagement
  - Target priority algorithms for fair and strategic gameplay

## Post-Implementation Documentation
- [ ] **Update DevCycle_2025_0003.md with Implementation Details**
  - [ ] Mark all completed tasks with [x]
  - [ ] Add implementation details for each completed system
  - [ ] Update timestamps and completion status
  - [ ] Add technical summary with files modified
  - [ ] Document any changes from original plan
  - [ ] Compare documentation approach with Tasks20250611_02.md implementation summary

- [ ] **Compare Implementation Documentation Approaches**
  - [ ] Review the comprehensive implementation summary format used in Tasks20250611_02.md
  - [ ] Analyze the detailed technical documentation, file-by-file breakdowns, and completion tracking
  - [ ] Apply similar documentation standards to future development cycles
  - [ ] Ensure consistent post-implementation documentation across all dev cycles
