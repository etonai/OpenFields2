# DevCycle 2025_0009 Brainstorm - Melee Combat System
*Created: June 14, 2025*
*Updated: June 16, 2025 - Focused on Melee Combat only, other systems moved to DevCycle 10*

## **DevCycle 9 - Melee Combat System**
**Focus**: Hand-to-hand combat mechanics and weapon systems

## **Melee Combat System**

### **Dual Weapon System**
**Core Concept**: Each character carries both ranged and melee weapons
- **Ranged Weapon**: Muskets, rifles, pistols for distance combat
- **Melee Weapon**: Swords, knives, tomahawks, or unarmed combat
- **Weapon Flexibility**: Same weapon can serve dual roles (e.g., rifle with bayonet)

### **Melee Weapon Types and Combinations**
**Single Weapons**:
- **Unarmed Combat**: Default melee option, no equipment required
- **Single Blade**: Sabre, sword, knife, tomahawk
- **Bayonet**: Attached to ranged weapon for combined functionality

**Weapon Combinations**:
- **Sword and Shield**: Enhanced defense with offensive capability
- **Sabre and Knife**: Dual-wielding for multiple attack options
- **Tomahawk and Knife**: Historical combination with throw/melee flexibility

### **Parry and Defense System**
**Defensive Mechanics**:
- **Parry Score**: Each weapon has inherent defensive capability
- **Single Target Defense**: Character can only parry one attack at a time
- **Parry Cooldown**: Prevents successive parrying, creates tactical timing
- **Attack Cooldown**: Melee attacks have recovery time between strikes

**Defensive Actions**:
- **Block and Attack**: Special ability combining defense with counter-offense
- **Automatic Defense**: When targeted by melee attack, character automatically attempts parry/dodge
- **Defense Roll**: Defender makes skill check to nullify incoming attack
- **Counter Attack**: Successful defense enables faster counter-attack than normal attack speed

### **Combat Flow Integration**
**Melee vs Ranged Balance**:
- **Range Transition**: Characters switch from ranged to melee based on distance
- **Weapon Readiness**: Time required to switch between ranged and melee weapons
- **Formation Impact**: Melee combat affects unit formations and positioning
- **Tactical Decisions**: Players choose when to close distance for melee engagement

### **Technical Implementation Considerations**
**New Systems Required**:
- **Melee Weapon Data**: Stats for parry scores, attack speeds, damage
- **Defense Timing**: Cooldown management for parry and counter-attack
- **Range Detection**: Automatic weapon switching based on target distance
- **Animation States**: Visual feedback for parry, block, counter-attack actions

**Integration with Existing Systems**:
- **Character Stats**: Dexterity and Reflexes affect melee performance
- **Skill System**: New melee weapon skills (Sword, Knife, Unarmed, etc.)
- **Equipment Management**: Dual weapon carrying and switching
- **Combat Resolution**: Melee hit calculations and damage application

### **Design Questions for Melee Combat**
1. **Weapon Switching**: Should characters automatically switch to melee when enemies close distance?
2. **Reach Advantage**: Should longer weapons (spears, bayonets) have reach advantages?
3. **Formation Fighting**: How does melee combat affect group formations?
4. **Dual Wielding**: Should dual weapon combinations provide mechanical advantages?
5. **Fatigue System**: Should extended melee combat cause character exhaustion?
6. **Grappling**: Should unarmed combat include wrestling/grappling mechanics?

## **Next Steps for DevCycle 9 Planning**

1. **Design melee weapon data structures** and combat mechanics
2. **Plan melee combat integration** with existing ranged combat system
3. **Evaluate dual weapon system implementation** for weapon switching
4. **Design parry and defense mechanics** timing and cooldowns
5. **Plan melee skill system integration** with existing character skills
6. **Create technical implementation plan** when ready to move to DevCycle_2025_0009.md
