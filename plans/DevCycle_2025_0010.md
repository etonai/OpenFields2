**Estimated Complexity:** Low-Medium - Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps and targeted solutions

## Bug Analysis and Implementation Plan

### BUG-10-001: Melee Auto-Targeting Movement Doesn't Trigger Automatic Attacks ⏳

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Identified  
**Category:** Combat System - Automatic Targeting

**Description:**
When a character with a melee weapon equipped has automatic targeting enabled, the character incorrectly starts shooting instead of performing melee attacks. The auto-targeting system should work differently for melee weapons compared to ranged weapons.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Character with melee weapon and auto-targeting enabled should automatically select hostile targets
- Character should move into melee range if not already there
- Character should automatically initiate melee attacks when in range
- Process should be seamless like ranged auto-targeting but with melee combat

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The automatic targeting system is not weapon-type aware. When auto-targeting is enabled with a melee weapon equipped, the system defaults to ranged combat behavior (shooting) instead of melee combat behavior (moving to range and attacking with melee weapon).

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Investigate Auto-Targeting Logic** (Day 1)
   - Review `Character.updateAutomaticTargeting()` method for combat mode awareness
   - Research M key functionality to understand melee/ranged mode switching
   - Identify where auto-targeting defaults to shooting behavior
   - Find how character combat mode is tracked and accessed

2. **Implement Combat Mode Aware Auto-Targeting** (Day 1-2)
   - Check character's combat mode (melee vs ranged) in auto-targeting system
   - Route melee mode auto-targeting to melee combat logic
   - Route ranged mode auto-targeting to ranged combat logic
   - Ensure weapon switching stops current attacks until new weapon is ready
   - Defer abstract `equippedWeapon` property architectural improvements

3. **Test and Validate** (Day 2)
   - Test auto-targeting with melee weapons (should perform melee attacks)
   - Test auto-targeting with ranged weapons (should continue shooting)
   - Verify weapon switching preserves correct auto-targeting behavior

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Auto-targeting and melee movement integration
- `src/main/java/InputManager.java` - Auto-targeting behavior verification

### BUG-10-002: Melee Weapons Missing Projectile Names ⏳

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Identified  
**Category:** Data Configuration

**Description:**
The melee weapons in `melee-weapons.json` are missing `projectileName` fields that match the weapon names. This creates inconsistency with the ranged weapon system and may cause issues in combat message display and weapon identification.

**Expected Behavior:**
- All melee weapons should have `projectileName` field in JSON configuration
- Projectile names should match or relate to the weapon names appropriately
- System should be consistent between ranged and melee weapon data structures

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Update Melee Weapon JSON Files** (Day 1)
   - Add `projectileName` field to all weapons in test_theme/melee-weapons.json
   - Add `projectileName` field to all weapons in civil_war/melee-weapons.json
   - Use descriptive names that match weapon types (e.g., "dagger strike", "sword slash")

2. **Update Data Loading** (Day 1)
   - Verify `MeleeWeaponData.java` includes projectileName field
   - Ensure `MeleeWeaponFactory.java` processes projectileName correctly
   - Update weapon creation to use projectile names from JSON data

3. **Test Data Loading** (Day 1)
   - Verify all melee weapons load correctly with new projectile names
   - Test weapon creation and projectile name assignment
   - Ensure backward compatibility if any existing saves reference melee weapons

**Example Projectile Names:**
- Steel Dagger → "dagger strike"
- Longsword → "sword slash"  
- Battle Axe → "axe blow"
- Enchanted Sword → "magical slash"

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/melee-weapons.json`
- `src/main/resources/data/themes/civil_war/melee-weapons.json`
- `src/main/java/data/MeleeWeaponData.java` (if projectileName field missing)
- `src/main/java/combat/MeleeWeaponFactory.java` (if projectileName handling needed)

### BUG-10-003: Excessive Melee Damage Calculation ⏳

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Identified  
**Category:** Combat System - Damage Calculation

**Description:**
Melee weapons are causing excessive damage, with light wounds from a dagger dealing 11 points of damage. This appears to be unrealistic compared to the weapon's base damage and wound severity. The damage calculation seems to be applying incorrect modifiers or using wrong formulas.

**Analysis of Problem:**
From the debug output:
```
>>> projectile hit 1003:Drake in the chest causing a light wound at tick 437
>>> 1003:Drake takes 11 damage
>>> 1003:Drake current health: 3/14
```

A Steel Dagger with base damage around 6 points causing 11 damage for a light wound suggests:
- Damage multipliers may be too high
- Strength modifiers may be incorrectly applied
- Wound severity calculation may be using wrong base values

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Analyze Current Damage Calculation** (Day 1)
   - Review `CombatResolver.resolveMeleeAttack()` damage calculation
   - Examine `CombatResolver.resolveRangedAttack()` as reference implementation
   - Add debug output to both melee and ranged damage calculations for comparison
   - Check strength modifier application using existing `statToModifier` function

2. **Fix Damage Formula** (Day 1-2)
   - Compare melee damage calculation with working ranged weapon damage calculation
   - Use existing `statToModifier` function for strength bonuses
   - Ensure wound severity is handled the same way as ranged weapons
   - Focus on making light wounds deal reasonable damage (6 + strength modifier for Steel Dagger)

3. **Test and Balance** (Day 2)
   - Test damage calculation with various weapons and character stats
   - Ensure light wounds deal appropriate damage relative to weapon base damage
   - Verify character survivability with corrected damage values

**Expected Damage Range:**
- Steel Dagger (base 6): Light wound should deal approximately 6 damage + strength modifier
- Strength modifiers should be additive based on character stat modifiers (typically +/-20 range)
- Wound severity should not dramatically increase base damage for light wounds

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/CombatResolver.java` - `resolveMeleeAttack()` damage calculation
- `src/main/java/OpenFields2.java` - If damage calculation occurs in main game loop

### BUG-10-004: Incorrect Combat Messages for Melee Attacks ⏳

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Identified  
**Category:** Combat System - User Feedback

**Description:**
Melee attacks are displaying "projectile hit" messages instead of appropriate melee attack messages. This is confusing and inconsistent with the nature of melee combat.

**Analysis of Problem:**
Debug output shows:
```
>>> projectile hit 1003:Drake in the chest causing a light wound at tick 437
```

This should display something like:
```
>>> Steel Dagger strikes 1003:Drake in the chest causing a light wound at tick 437
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Identify Message Source** (Day 1)
   - Locate where "projectile hit" messages are generated
   - Check if `CombatResolver.resolveCombatImpact()` is used for both ranged and melee
   - Determine if separate message handling is needed for melee attacks

2. **Implement Melee-Specific Messages** (Day 1)
   - Create appropriate combat messages for melee attacks
   - Use weapon-specific action words (strike, slash, thrust, etc.)
   - Ensure messages differentiate melee from ranged attacks clearly

3. **Update Combat Resolution** (Day 1-2)
   - Modify combat impact resolution to detect melee vs ranged attacks
   - Apply appropriate message formatting based on attack type
   - Ensure consistent message formatting across all melee weapons

**Suggested Message Formats:**
- `">>> [WeaponName] strikes [Target] in the [BodyPart] causing a [Severity] wound"`
- `">>> [Attacker] [ActionVerb] [Target] with [WeaponName] in the [BodyPart]"`

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/main/java/CombatResolver.java` - Combat impact message generation
- `src/main/java/OpenFields2.java` - If main game loop handles combat messages

## Implementation Clarifications Incorporated

Based on your answers, I've updated the bug descriptions and implementation plans:

### **BUG-10-001: Auto-Targeting Clarification**
- **Problem**: Characters with melee weapons start shooting when auto-targeting is enabled
- **Solution**: Make auto-targeting weapon-type aware (melee weapons → melee attacks, ranged weapons → shooting)
- **Debug output provided was manual targeting showing damage issue, not auto-targeting failure**

### **BUG-10-003: Damage Balance Clarification** 
- **Steel Dagger base damage of 6 is correct**
- **11 damage for light wound is excessive** 
- **Strength modifiers should be additive (not percentage-based)**
- **Focus on damage amount, not wound severity secondary effects**

### **BUG-10-002 & BUG-10-004: Architecture Clarification**
- **`projectileName` field name will change in future; keep current approach**
- **Shared combat system is acceptable for now**
- **Bravery checks and messages should be weapon-type aware**

### **Priority Clarification**
- **Highest Priority**: BUG-10-003 (excessive damage) - blocks gameplay
- **Second Priority**: BUG-10-001 (auto-targeting shoots instead of melee)
- **Keep remaining bugs separate for incremental approach**

## Implementation Clarifications Received

### **BUG-10-003: Damage Calculation Implementation**
**Clarifications:**
- Use existing `statToModifier` function for strength calculations
- Follow ranged weapon damage calculation pattern (includes wound severity handling)
- Issue is not wound severity determination - light wounds are correctly identified but dealing 11 damage instead of expected 6 + strength modifier
- Focus on comparing melee vs ranged damage calculation implementations

### **BUG-10-001: Auto-Targeting Implementation**
**Clarifications:**
- Auto-targeting should check character's combat mode (melee vs ranged), not weapon type directly
- Research M key functionality to understand how combat mode switching works
- When switching weapons during auto-targeting, current attacks should stop until new weapon is ready
- Defer abstract `equippedWeapon` property architectural improvements for now

## Final Implementation Approach

All clarifications have been received and incorporated. The implementation approach is now clear:

### **BUG-10-003: Damage Calculation Approach**
- Use `CombatResolver.resolveRangedAttack()` as reference implementation
- Add debug output to both melee and ranged damage calculations (debug mode only)
- Compare implementations to identify why melee deals 11 damage vs expected 6 + strength modifier
- Use existing `statToModifier` function for strength calculations

### **BUG-10-001: Auto-Targeting Approach**
- Research M key functionality to understand combat mode switching mechanism
- Find how character combat mode is tracked and accessed in the codebase
- Implement combat mode awareness in auto-targeting system
- Defer architectural improvements for cleaner weapon abstraction

## Ready for Implementation

The DevCycle 10 bug fixes are now fully planned with clear implementation steps and all necessary clarifications received. No additional questions are needed to proceed with implementation.
