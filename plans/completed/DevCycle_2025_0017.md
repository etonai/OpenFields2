- Integrate automatic skill-weapon bonus application
- Modernize terminology (projectileName → woundDescription)
- Add separated ranged/melee combat experience tracking

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 11: Critical combat math fixes (completed)
- DevCycle 16: UI improvements and weapon selection fixes (completed)
- Current weapon system functionality with JSON data loading

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Multiple interconnected systems with clean architectural improvements

## Post-Implementation Review ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Implementation Summary
**DevCycle 17 Successfully Completed - December 22, 2025**

**Actual Implementation Time**: Approximately 8 hours across multiple sessions

**Systems Completed**:
- **✅ Character Stats Display**: Enhanced detailed stats (Shift+/) to show both ranged and melee weapons with active weapon highlighting using [ACTIVE] markers
- **✅ Weapon ID System**: Added weaponId field to base Weapon class, eliminated findWeaponId() method with 30+ hardcoded mappings, implemented direct ID access throughout system
- **✅ Skill-Weapon Integration**: Added combatSkill field to weapon JSON files, implemented automatic skill bonus application for both ranged and melee weapons (+5 accuracy per skill level)
- **✅ Terminology Improvement**: Renamed projectileName to woundDescription throughout system for better semantic clarity, updated all JSON files and code references
- **✅ Combat Experience Tracking**: Enhanced existing system (from DevCycle 12) with separate ranged/melee statistics tracking and improved analytics display

### Key Achievements
- **Enhanced user experience** with comprehensive weapon information display showing both combat modes
- **Improved system architecture** with clean weapon ID access eliminating maintenance overhead
- **Automatic skill integration** providing balanced combat with transparent skill bonus application
- **Comprehensive analytics** enabling detailed character development tracking and combat analysis
- **Fixed critical wound description bug** where all wounds showed "projectile" instead of weapon-specific descriptions

### Files Modified
**Core Architecture**:
- **`combat/Weapon.java`**: Added weaponId field and woundDescription terminology
- **`combat/RangedWeapon.java`**: Fixed wound description setting in constructors
- **`combat/MeleeWeaponFactory.java`**: Added wound descriptions to all factory methods
- **`data/WeaponFactory.java`**: Updated to set weapon IDs during creation
- **`EditModeManager.java`**: Enhanced melee weapon creation with JSON wound descriptions

**Combat System Integration**:
- **`CombatResolver.java`**: Removed findWeaponId() method, implemented skill bonus integration, fixed wound description usage
- **`DisplayCoordinator.java`**: Enhanced character stats display with dual weapon support and active weapon highlighting

**User Interface**:
- **`MouseInputHandler.java`**: Updated brief stats display to include current health
- **`game/Unit.java`**: Enhanced visual name display with health information

**Data Files**:
- **JSON weapon files**: Updated all theme weapon files with combatSkill and woundDescription fields
- **Character and faction data**: Updated with latest character information

**Documentation**:
- **Planning documents**: Updated DevCycle 17 plan with completion status and achievements

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insights**: Weapon system architecture benefits significantly from centralized ID management and consistent terminology. The distinction between projectileName and woundDescription improved code clarity substantially.
- **Process Improvements**: Early identification of related bugs (wound description display) during implementation allowed for comprehensive fixes rather than piecemeal solutions.
- **Integration Benefits**: Automatic skill-weapon integration eliminates manual combat calculation complexity while maintaining game balance.

### Critical Bug Resolution
During implementation, discovered and resolved a critical bug where wound descriptions always showed "from projectile" instead of weapon-specific descriptions. Root cause was incomplete field assignment in weapon constructors. Fix ensures proper combat feedback with descriptions like "from bullet", "from plasma bolt", "from blade", etc.

### Design Decisions
- **Weapon ID Architecture**: Chose simple string field approach over complex ID management system for maintainability
- **Skill Integration**: Implemented one skill per weapon mapping for simplicity while maintaining combat balance
- **Display Enhancement**: Focused on detailed mode (Shift+/) rather than brief selection display to avoid UI clutter
- **Terminology Consistency**: Prioritized semantic clarity over backward compatibility with direct field replacement

### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced skill system** with experience-based training and character progression
- **Enhanced combat analytics** with battle reports and performance tracking over time
- **Dynamic weapon recommendation** system based on character skills and situation context
- **Weapon modification system** with customizable weapon attributes and upgrades
