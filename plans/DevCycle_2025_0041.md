# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0041
*Created: July 5, 2025 at 12:45 PM | Last Design Update: July 5, 2025 at 12:45 PM | Last Implementation Update: TBD | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on implementing multiple varied tasks to improve system stability, fix critical bugs, and enhance game mechanics. The cycle will address several independent issues and improvements identified through testing and analysis.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement comprehensive deterministic random number control system for reliable testing and debugging
- Implement additional system improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 40 completed with all critical tests passing
- Understanding of current random number usage in CombatCalculator.java and CharacterFactory.java

**Estimated Complexity:** High - Comprehensive random number control system affects multiple core components

- **Migration Strategy**: Incremental replacement of random calls with comprehensive testing at each step

### Planning Questions for User Review

#### Technical Implementation Questions:

EDNOTE: If I have made no comment in a question, use the recommendation.

1. **Package Structure**: Where should the new classes (RandomProvider and GameConfiguration) be placed in the package hierarchy? Should they go in a new `utils` package, the existing `game` package, or somewhere else?
   
   **Recommendation**: Create a new `utils` package for both RandomProvider and GameConfiguration. This follows the pattern of utility classes and keeps them separate from game logic.

2. **Singleton vs Static**: Should RandomProvider and GameConfiguration be implemented as singletons (getInstance() pattern) or as static utility classes? What's the project's preference for global state management?
   
   **Recommendation**: Use static utility classes similar to CombatCalculator. The project already uses this pattern extensively, and it's simpler than singleton management.

3. **Default Behavior**: When the game starts normally (not in test mode), should deterministic mode be:
   - Always OFF by default?
   - Configurable via a properties file?
   - Controllable via command-line arguments?
   
   **Recommendation**: Always OFF by default. Deterministic mode should be explicitly enabled for tests. No need for properties files or command-line arguments initially.

4. **Random Number Sources**: Beyond CombatCalculator and CharacterFactory, are there other files that use random numbers that should be included in this system? (e.g., AI decision-making, terrain generation, etc.)
   
   **Recommendation**: Focus only on CombatCalculator and CharacterFactory for now. Other sources can be added later if discovered during implementation.

#### Integration Questions:
5. **Test Framework Integration**: Should the deterministic mode integration be:
   - Built into the test base classes?
   - Implemented as a JUnit extension/rule?
   - Left as manual setup in each test?
   
   **Recommendation**: Use manual setup in each test. This gives maximum control and visibility. Tests can simply call `GameConfiguration.setDeterministicMode(true, 12345)` in their setup.

6. **Seed Management Strategy**: For the "multiple seed strategies" mentioned, what specific strategies are needed?
   - Fixed seed per test class?
   - Incrementing seeds for each test method?
   - User-specified seeds via annotations?
   
   **Recommendation**: Start with fixed seed per test class. Each test can define its own seed value. This is the simplest approach and provides reproducibility.

#### Scope Questions:
7. **Performance Testing**: What specific performance benchmarks should be used to verify the < 5% overhead requirement? Should we create a dedicated performance test?
   
   **Recommendation**: Skip performance testing since performance is not a concern. Just ensure the system works correctly.

8. **Configuration Persistence**: What format should be used for configuration persistence (mentioned in GameConfiguration tasks)? JSON, properties file, or something else?
   
   **Recommendation**: No persistence needed. Keep it in-memory only for simplicity.

9. **Test-Specific Overloads**: Should the overloaded methods in CombatCalculator:
   - Replace the existing methods (with default Random parameter)?
   - Be completely separate methods with different names?
   - Use method overloading with additional Random parameter?
   
   **Recommendation**: Use method overloading with additional Random parameter. This preserves existing method signatures while adding new capabilities.

#### Design Clarifications:
10. **Thread Safety Requirements**: Is thread safety actually needed for the current game architecture, or is this future-proofing? The game appears to be single-threaded based on the JavaFX Timeline usage.
    
    **Recommendation**: Skip thread safety. The game is single-threaded, so no need for complexity.

11. **Debug Output**: What format/location should be used for "clear debug output for deterministic mode status"? Console logging, separate debug file, or integration with existing debug systems?
    
    **Recommendation**: Use simple console logging when deterministic mode is enabled, similar to existing debug output in the game.

12. **Backward Compatibility Testing**: Should we create specific tests to verify that non-deterministic mode behavior remains unchanged, or is passing existing tests sufficient?
    
    **Recommendation**: Just ensure existing tests pass. No need for specific compatibility tests since we're not worried about backwards compatibility.

### 2. [Next System] ‚≠ï **TBD**
*To be determined after System 1 is complete and tested. DO NOT plan this section until System 1 is finished.*

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION TO THIS SECTION UNTIL SYSTEM 1 IS COMPLETE**
- No system names or descriptions
- No implementation tasks or components
- No design specifications
- No technical notes
- This section exists only as a placeholder for future planning

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

*Note: This section will be updated as each system is completed and interactions are discovered.*

- **System 1 + Combat System**: RandomProvider integrates with all combat calculations without changing behavior
- **System 1 + Character Creation**: GameConfiguration controls both combat and character generation randomness
- **System 1 + Test Framework**: Test-specific overloads provide precise control for unit and integration tests
- **Event Queue Management**: Random number generation timing preserved, no impact on ScheduledEvent timing

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **System 1**: Foundational improvement enabling better testing and debugging for all future systems (highest priority)
2. **Future Systems**: Priority determined after System 1 completion

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`CombatCalculator.java`** - Replace Math.random() calls with RandomProvider calls
- **`CharacterFactory.java`** - Integrate with RandomProvider and GameConfiguration
- **`HeadlessGunfightTest.java`** - Add deterministic mode examples and integration
- **Test files** - Add deterministic mode integration for MeleeCombatTestAutomated

**New Components Required:**
- **RandomProvider**: Centralized random number generation with seed control
- **GameConfiguration**: Runtime deterministic mode management and configuration persistence

### Data Flow
**Information flow for System 1:**
1. **GameConfiguration.setDeterministicMode(true, seed)** ‚Üí **RandomProvider.setSeed(seed)** ‚Üí **Deterministic random values**

## üîÑ CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ‚úÖ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ‚ùå **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- üîÑ **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ‚úÖ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ‚≠ï **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- üö´ **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- üîÑ **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ‚ö†Ô∏è

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

---

*This iterative development cycle focuses on implementing one system at a time while maintaining flexibility for additional improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*
