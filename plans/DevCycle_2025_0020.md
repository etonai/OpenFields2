# Burst Firing Fix - DevCycle 2025_0020
*Created: 2025-06-24 | Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses specifically on implementing correct burst firing functionality in the OpenFields2 tactical combat game. The current burst firing implementation needs to be fixed to match the intended specification.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement correct burst firing timing using `firingDelay` from weapon stats
- Fix bullet count to use `burstSize` from weapon configuration (ranged-weapons.json)
- Implement proper hit determination: first bullet normal accuracy, subsequent bullets with Quick aiming speed (-20 penalty)
- Ensure proper integration with existing combat systems

**Burst Firing Specification:**
- **Bullet Count**: Exactly `burstSize` bullets (e.g., UZI fires 3 bullets total)
- **Timing**: First bullet normal, subsequent bullets fired every `firingDelay` ticks from when aiming completes (e.g., UZI: bullet 2 at +6 ticks, bullet 3 at +12 ticks)
- **Accuracy**: First bullet uses character's current aiming speed, bullets 2+ receive fixed -20 accuracy penalty (Quick aiming modifier)
- **State Management**: Character's aiming speed state never changes during burst - only accuracy modifiers are applied
- **Interruption**: Burst can be interrupted by mode switch, incapacitation, or new attack command; aiming speed remains unchanged

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 19 completed (Platform Integration and Combat Enhancement)
- Burst mode analysis documentation available
- Combat system stabilized with first attack penalty system

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Focused debugging and fixing of existing system

## System Analysis

### 1. Burst Firing Implementation ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] **Current State Assessment**
  - [ ] Test current burst firing behavior with UZI (burstSize: 3, firingDelay: 6)
  - [ ] Verify timing of subsequent bullets (should be +6, +12 ticks)
  - [ ] Check if burstSize from weapon config is being used correctly
  - [ ] Validate accuracy penalties for bullets 2 and 3 (should use Quick aiming = -20)

- [ ] **Implementation Requirements**
  - [ ] Fix timing to use `firingDelay` instead of `cyclicRate` for both burst and full auto modes
  - [ ] Ensure bullet count matches weapon's `burstSize` property (support any burstSize: 2, 3, 4+)
  - [ ] Apply fixed -20 accuracy penalty to bullets 2+ (do not change character's aiming speed state)
  - [ ] Maintain first bullet using character's current aiming speed
  - [ ] Implement consistent behavior between burst and full auto modes

**Analysis Framework:**
- **Systematic Testing**: Test each component of burst firing individually
- **Event Tracing**: Monitor ScheduledEvent queue during burst sequences
- **State Debugging**: Track isAutomaticFiring and burstShotsFired variables
- **Integration Validation**: Ensure compatibility with recent combat system changes

### 2. Core Burst Mechanics Implementation üîß **PENDING**
- [ ] **Timing Implementation**
  - [ ] Change burst timing from `cyclicRate` to `firingDelay`
  - [ ] Fix bullet scheduling: bullet 2 at fireTick + firingDelay, bullet 3 at fireTick + (firingDelay * 2)
  - [ ] Ensure proper timing for all burst-capable weapons
  - [ ] Validate timing matches weapon configuration

- [ ] **Accuracy Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement Quick aiming speed (-20 penalty) for bullets 2+
  - [ ] Preserve character's original aiming speed for first bullet
  - [ ] Ensure accuracy modifiers apply correctly in hit calculations
  - [ ] Test with different starting aiming speeds (Careful, Normal, Quick)

- [ ] **Burst Size Implementation**
  - [ ] Use weapon's `burstSize` property for total bullet count
  - [ ] Ensure burst terminates after exactly `burstSize` bullets
  - [ ] Handle different burst sizes for different weapons
  - [ ] Validate burst completion logic

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Primary Fix Areas

**1. Character Burst State Management**
- File: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
- Focus: Lines around 1118-1162 (burst scheduling code)
- Key Variables: `isAutomaticFiring`, `burstShotsFired`
- Note: `savedAimingSpeed` may be removed/refactored since aiming speed state should not change

**2. Firing Mode Integration**
- File: `src/main/java/combat/RangedWeapon.java`
- Focus: Firing mode cycling and burst configuration
- Key Methods: `cycleFiringMode()`, burst size validation

**3. Event Scheduling System**
- File: `src/main/java/game/ScheduledEvent.java` integration
- Focus: Proper burst shot event creation and execution
- Key Areas: Event timing, cleanup, and interruption handling

### Specific Implementation Requirements

**A. Timing Correction**
- Replace `cyclicRate` with `firingDelay` for burst shot intervals (and full auto)
- UZI example: bullet 2 at +6 ticks, bullet 3 at +12 ticks (firingDelay = 6)
- Ensure timing calculation: nextShotTick = fireTick + (firingDelay * (shotNumber - 1))
- Note: shotNumber is 1-based (1st bullet = 1, 2nd bullet = 2, etc.)
- Full auto continues indefinitely until trigger release or ammo depletion
- After burst/auto ends, cooldown depends on weapon's firing delay and character's aiming speed

**B. Accuracy Implementation**
- First bullet: Use character's current aiming speed with first attack penalty if applicable
- Bullets 2+: Apply fixed -20 accuracy penalty (Quick aiming modifier) without changing character state
- First attack penalty (-15) only applies to the first bullet of the burst
- Modifiers stack: movement penalties and wound modifiers add to the -20 quick penalty
- Example: Moving character (-5) firing burst bullet 2 = -25 total accuracy modifier
- Integrate with existing hit determination system

**C. Burst Size Configuration**
- Read `burstSize` from weapon JSON configuration
- Schedule exactly `burstSize` total bullets per burst (or available ammo if less)
- Support different burst sizes for different weapons
- Full auto has no maximum burst length limit
- Allow burst activation even with insufficient ammo (fire what's available)

**D. Event Management**
- Immediately cancel pending burst/auto events when interrupted by:
  - Firing mode switch
  - Character incapacitation (shooter only - target death does not interrupt)
  - New attack command
  - Hesitation state (from wounds)
- No conditional checking - events are removed from queue immediately
- Clean event queue to prevent orphaned events
- Exception: Target death/incapacitation does NOT interrupt burst - remaining bullets fire at corpse location

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing Approach
- [ ] **Individual Component Tests**
  - Test burst state transitions in isolation
  - Validate event scheduling mathematics
  - Check ammunition consumption calculations
  - Verify aiming speed transitions

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Burst Scenarios**
  - UZI burst firing: 3 bullets at +0, +6, +12 ticks
  - Burst firing with Careful aiming (first bullet careful, bullets 2-3 quick)
  - Burst firing with Normal aiming (first bullet normal, bullets 2-3 quick)  
  - Burst firing with Quick aiming (all bullets quick)
  - Burst interruption by shooter incapacitation, hesitation, or mode switch
  - Burst continuation when target dies mid-burst (bullets fire at corpse)
  - Partial burst with insufficient ammo (2 rounds for 3-round burst)

### 3. Combat System Integration
- [ ] **Compatibility Validation**
  - Burst firing with first attack penalty system
  - Burst firing with very careful aiming
  - Burst firing in different movement states
  - Burst firing with wound modifiers active

## Implementation Complete - No Further Questions

All implementation details have been clarified. The plan is ready for development with the following key decisions:

- **Timing**: Use firingDelay for both burst and full auto modes
- **Accuracy**: Fixed -20 penalty for bullets 2+ (stacks with other modifiers)
- **State Management**: Never change character's aiming speed during burst/auto
- **Interruptions**: Hesitation, mode switch, and new attacks stop burst; target death does not
- **Edge Cases**: Partial bursts allowed with insufficient ammo; bullets continue at corpse location
- **Logging**: Detailed per-bullet logs with separate hit/miss lines

The development can proceed with Phase 1: Diagnosis.
