## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`Character.java`** - Reduce from 2,645 to under 2,000 lines
- **`combat/managers/IMovementManager.java`** - New interface for movement
- **`combat/managers/MovementManager.java`** - New file for movement logic
- **`combat/managers/ISkillsManager.java`** - New interface for skills
- **`combat/managers/SkillsManager.java`** - New file for skills logic
- **`combat/managers/ICharacterStatsManager.java`** - New interface for stats
- **`combat/managers/CharacterStatsManager.java`** - New file for stats logic
- **`combat/managers/ITargetManager.java`** - New interface for targeting
- **`combat/managers/TargetManager.java`** - New file for targeting logic
- **`CombatCoordinator.java`** - Update to include new managers

**New Components Required:**
- **MovementManager**: Handle all movement and positioning logic
- **SkillsManager**: Manage character skills and development
- **CharacterStatsManager**: Handle stats, health, and modifiers
- **TargetManager**: Manage targeting and hostility logic
- **Manager Interfaces**: Formal contracts for each new manager

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Movement** → **MovementManager** → **Position Updates** → **Combat Systems**
2. **Skills Query** → **SkillsManager** → **Skill Modifiers** → **Combat Calculations**
3. **Health Update** → **CharacterStatsManager** → **Status Changes** → **Game State**
4. **Targeting** → **TargetManager** → **Valid Targets** → **Combat Actions**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Slight increase from new manager instances (minimal)
- **CPU Usage**: Same or better - optimized code paths
- **Rendering Impact**: None - internal refactoring only
- **Save File Size**: No change - transient state remains transient

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Architecture Questions
1. **Manager Consistency**: Should the new managers follow the same singleton pattern as the DevCycle 29 managers?
2. **State Management**: Should the new managers use the same HashMap-based per-character state tracking?
3. **Integration Pattern**: Should Character.java continue using delegation, or should some methods be completely removed?

### Priority Questions  
4. **Extraction Order**: Is the proposed order (Movement → Skills → Stats → Targeting) acceptable?
5. **Line Reduction Target**: Is the goal of under 2,000 lines appropriate, or should we target a different number?

### Scope Questions
6. **Manager Scope**: Are there any proposed extractions you'd prefer to defer to a future cycle?
7. **Optimization Level**: How aggressive should we be with code consolidation and dead code removal?

### Testing Questions
8. **Test Strategy**: Should we create new test classes for each new manager?
9. **Integration Testing**: What level of integration testing is required for the new architecture?

**Implementation Note**: This DevCycle builds on the successful manager-based architecture from DevCycle 29, extending the pattern to achieve significant line reduction while maintaining the clean, maintainable codebase structure.
