# Character Management Foundation - DevCycle 2025_0008
*Created: June 14, 2025 06:56 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 14, 2025 07:31 PM PDT | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on establishing a robust character management foundation for OpenFields2. The primary objective is to create persistent character storage and deployment systems that will enable large-scale scenario development in future cycles.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement character creation and deployment workflow (CTRL-C/CTRL-A)
- Create persistent character storage system using faction files containing faction data and character rosters
- Redesign faction system with proper Faction class (ID, name, allies, enemies, color)
- Add unit deletion capability (DEL key with confirmation)
- Enable character statistics tracking across battle sessions

**Prerequisites:** 
- Existing character creation system in edit mode
- Current save/load framework
- Character statistics tracking from DevCycle 7

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Clear interfaces but requires new file management and UI integration

## System Implementations

### 1. Character Creation and Deployment System ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **CTRL-C Character Creation Interface**
  - [ ] Modify existing CTRL-C handler to prompt for character quantity
  - [ ] Display existing character archetype selection menu
  - [ ] Create specified number of characters using selected archetype
  - [ ] Save created characters to appropriate faction file in factions/ directory
  - [ ] Provide confirmation message for successful character creation

- [ ] **CTRL-A Character Deployment Interface**
  - [ ] Implement new CTRL-A keyboard handler with multi-step workflow
  - [ ] Prompt for number of characters to deploy
  - [ ] Prompt for faction selection from available factions
  - [ ] Request click location for first unit placement
  - [ ] Prompt for formation direction (line right vs line down)
  - [ ] Prompt for unit spacing in feet between characters
  - [ ] Load faction data and filter non-incapacitated characters from selected faction file
  - [ ] Validate sufficient characters available before deployment
  - [ ] Position characters in formation with specified spacing
  - [ ] Arm deployed characters with scenario-appropriate weapons
  - [ ] Provide error feedback if insufficient characters available

- [ ] **DEL Key Unit Deletion**
  - [ ] Implement DEL key handler for selected units
  - [ ] Add confirmation dialog for unit deletion
  - [ ] Remove unit from current scenario only (preserve faction character files)
  - [ ] Handle edge cases for units in combat or with scheduled events
  - [ ] Provide visual feedback for successful deletion

**Design Specifications:**
- **Character Creation Flow**: CTRL-C → Quantity prompt → Existing archetype menu → Batch creation → Save to faction file in characters/ directory
- **Character Deployment Flow**: CTRL-A → Quantity prompt → Faction selection → Click placement → Formation direction → Spacing → Deploy formation → Weapon assignment
- **Unit Deletion Flow**: Select unit → DEL key → Confirmation dialog → Remove from scenario (faction files unchanged)
- **Formation System**: Line formations (right/down) with configurable spacing in feet using 7 pixels = 1 foot conversion
- **Character Filtering**: Only deploy non-incapacitated characters from faction files
- **File Organization**: factions/ directory with faction files (0.json, 1.json, 2.json, 3.json) containing faction data and character rosters
- **User Interface**: Sequential prompts for deployment workflow, formation positioning system
- **Performance Requirements**: Handle formation placement of 20+ characters efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Validation for sufficient characters, faction availability, formation placement bounds

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `InputManager.java`, existing archetype menu code, `Character.java`, unit management code
- **New Classes/Enums**: `CharacterSelectionDialog.java`, `CharacterPersistenceManager.java`

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Faction System Redesign**: Foundation for character organization and relationships (highest priority)
2. **Character Persistence System**: Depends on faction system for file organization (high priority)
3. **Character Creation and Deployment System**: User interface that uses both faction and persistence systems (high priority)
4. **Manual Victory System**: Battle resolution that updates faction and character data (high priority)
5. **Documentation Updates**: Ensure users understand new functionality (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`InputManager.java`** - Add CTRL-C and CTRL-A keyboard handlers
- **`Character.java`** - Add serialization support for character persistence
- **`GameRenderer.java`** - Add UI dialogs for character creation/selection

**New Components Required:**
- **CharacterPersistenceManager**: Handles faction file operations
- **Faction**: Core faction class with properties and relationship methods
- **FactionRegistry**: Management system for all factions
- **CharacterSelectionDialog**: UI for character deployment selection
- **BattleResultsDialog**: UI for victory outcome selection per faction
- **VictoryOutcome**: Enum for victory/defeat/participant outcomes
- **CharacterData**: Serializable data structure for JSON storage

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Application Start** → **Load Factions** → **Initialize FactionRegistry** → **Ready for Character Operations**
2. **CTRL-C Press** → **Quantity Input** → **Archetype Selection** → **Faction Assignment** → **Batch Character Creation** → **Save to Faction File**
3. **CTRL-A Press** → **Quantity Input** → **Faction Selection** → **Click Placement** → **Formation Direction** → **Spacing Input** → **Load Non-Incapacitated Characters** → **Formation Deployment** → **Weapon Assignment**
4. **DEL Key Press** → **Confirmation Dialog** → **Remove Unit from Scenario** (faction files unchanged)
5. **CTRL-SHIFT-V Press** → **Identify Scenario Factions** → **Outcome Selection per Faction** → **Update All Character Victory Counts** → **Update Faction Statistics** → **Save Faction Files** → **End Scenario**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - character data loaded on demand
- **CPU Usage**: Low - simple JSON operations
- **Rendering Impact**: UI dialogs only, no continuous rendering overhead
- **File I/O**: Efficient JSON parsing for character data
