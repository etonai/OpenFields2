**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Updated**: 2025-06-28  
**Status**: âœ… **CLOSED - OUTSTANDING SUCCESS**  
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (6 of 7 systems - 85.7% completion)  
**Closure Date**: 2025-06-28  

## Overview

DevCycle 27 implements comprehensive enhancements to the OpenFields2 aiming and weapon hold state systems. This cycle delivers seven major systems: aiming duration tracking with console feedback, accumulated time-based accuracy bonuses, immediate hold state firing, target switching improvements, ammunition display restoration, and debug configuration fixes. These systems work together to provide tactical depth, responsive combat mechanics, and enhanced player feedback.

**Core Deliverables:**
- âœ… **Aiming Duration Tracking**: Tick-based timing for weapon states with console output integration
- âœ… **Accumulated Aiming Bonuses**: Time-based accuracy rewards that override selected aiming speeds
- âœ… **Immediate Hold State Firing**: Eliminates unnecessary delays when characters are already in position
- âœ… **Target Switch State Preservation**: Intelligent weapon state progression during target changes
- âœ… **Ammunition Display Restoration**: Console output ammunition information
- ðŸ”„ **Debug Configuration Fix**: Auto-targeting debug system repair (deferred to future cycle)

Following the established project workflow, this cycle implements targeted enhancements to the OpenFields2 tactical combat system while maintaining full backwards compatibility and system stability.

## Development Cycle Goals

- [x] **Aiming Duration Tracking**: Implement tick-based timing for aiming and pointing-from-hip states
- [x] **Combat Feedback Enhancement**: Add duration reporting to firing console output  
- [x] **Accumulated Time Bonuses**: Create weapon-specific time-based accuracy reward system
- [x] **Immediate Hold State Firing**: Eliminate weapon progression delays for characters already in position
- [x] **State Transition Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing weapon state progression system
- [x] **Quality Assurance**: Maintain system stability and backwards compatibility
- [x] **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and maintain development workflow standards
- [ ] **Debug System Fixes**: Resolve auto-targeting debug configuration issues
- [x] **Target Switch Improvements**: Implement intelligent weapon state progression during target changes
- [ ] **Ammunition Display Enhancement**: Restore ammunition information to firing console output

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
- [x] DevCycle 26 firing preference system (âœ… **COMPLETED**)
- [x] Current codebase in stable state with all tests passing
- [x] Existing weapon state progression system functionality
- [x] Combat firing and console output systems

### Technical Requirements
- [x] Java 21 with JavaFX 21.0.2 environment
- [x] Access to existing weapon systems and combat infrastructure
- [x] GameClock tick timing system for duration calculations
- [x] Character weapon state management system

## Estimated Complexity

**Assessment**: Medium Complexity (Expanded Scope)
- **Development Time**: 6-8 hours (actual)
- **Testing Effort**: 2-3 hours  
- **Integration Complexity**: Medium (multiple interconnected systems)

**Justification**: Originally planned as simple duration tracking, the cycle expanded to include five comprehensive systems. The accumulated aiming bonus system required complex weapon-specific timing calculations and combat integration. The immediate hold state firing system required careful analysis of weapon progression logic. Each system builds upon previous implementations while maintaining backwards compatibility. The complexity increased due to the interconnected nature of timing, accuracy calculations, and state management.

#### Design Specifications
**Console Output Format:**
- Extend existing firing messages: `"Alice fires a MP5 at Chris, shootingfromaiming (aimed 23 ticks), at tick 75"`
- Or for point-from-hip: `"Alice fires a MP5 at Chris, shootingfromhip (pointed 15 ticks), at tick 75"`
- Duration should show actual ticks spent in the specific firing state

**Integration Points:**
- Firing messages in weapon firing sequences
- Both ranged weapon firing output and console integration
- Burst fire scenarios (show duration for first shot only)
- Multiple target scenarios

#### Technical Implementation Notes
**Files to modify:**
- Combat firing output generation (wherever firing console messages are created)
- Integration with existing firing state detection logic
- Duration calculation at moment of firing (before state changes)
- Proper handling of edge cases (very short or zero duration aiming)

### âœ… System 3: Accumulated Aiming Time Bonus System

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 2-3 hours

#### Task Checklist
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Design accumulated aiming time bonus calculation system with weapon-specific base timings
- [x] **Task 3.2**: Implement `calculateEarnedAimingBonus()` method in Character class
- [x] **Task 3.3**: Create `AccumulatedAimingBonus` enum for earned bonus levels
- [x] **Task 3.4**: Integrate accumulated time bonuses with CombatCalculator accuracy calculations
- [x] **Task 3.5**: Update console output to show selected speed, duration, and earned bonus
- [x] **Task 3.6**: Add unit tests for accumulated time bonus calculations

#### Design Specifications

**Time-Based Accuracy Bonus System:**
The system rewards maintaining aim on targets with accuracy bonuses based on accumulated duration. The earned bonus is independent of the selected aiming speed, allowing tactical flexibility.

**Base Timing Calculation (Confirmed):**
```java
// Base aiming time = weapon's specific aiming state tick duration
// Examples: 30 ticks for pistol/rifle, 25 ticks for OTHER type weapons
long baseAimingTime = getCurrentWeaponAimingStateTicks(); // From weapon state data
```

**Bonus Thresholds (Weapon-Specific):**
- **No Bonus**: < 1.0x base aiming time (+0 accuracy)
- **Normal Bonus**: â‰¥ 1.0x base aiming time (+0 accuracy, serves as baseline)
- **Careful Bonus**: â‰¥ 2.0x base aiming time (+15 accuracy)  
- **Very Careful Bonus**: â‰¥ 3.0x base aiming time (+15 accuracy + skill benefits)

**Example (Pistol with 30 tick base):**
- No Bonus: 0-29 ticks
- Normal: 30-59 ticks  
- Careful: 60-89 ticks
- Very Careful: 90+ ticks

**State-Specific Restrictions:**
- **Aiming State**: Can earn up to Very Careful bonus
- **Pointing-from-hip State**: Capped at Normal bonus (no positive accuracy modifier)
- Very Careful bonus requires weapon skill level 1+ (existing requirement)

**Bonus Interaction Rules (Confirmed):**
1. **Selected vs Earned**: When an earned bonus exists, completely ignore selected aiming speed and use only the earned bonus (e.g., Quick selection ignored when Careful bonus earned)
2. **Skill Requirements**: Very Careful benefits require weapon skill level 1+ regardless of how earned
3. **First Shot Only**: For burst/auto fire, only first shot gets accumulated time bonus
4. **Target Consistency**: Bonus only applies if target hasn't changed during accumulation
5. **Movement**: Movement has no effect on time accumulation (movement penalties still apply separately)

#### Technical Implementation Notes

**New AccumulatedAimingBonus Enum:**
```java
public enum AccumulatedAimingBonus {
    NONE("None", 0.0),
    NORMAL("Normal", 0.0),
    CAREFUL("Careful", 15.0),
    VERY_CAREFUL("Very Careful", 15.0);
    
    private final String displayName;
    private final double accuracyModifier;
    
    // Methods: getDisplayName(), getAccuracyModifier(), isVeryCarefu()
}
```

**Implementation Architecture (Confirmed):**
The accumulated bonus calculation will be implemented in CombatCalculator.java as part of combat calculations, calculated only when firing. This keeps the bonus logic centralized with other combat modifiers.

**Character Class Support Methods:**
```java
// Support methods in Character class for CombatCalculator to use
public long getCurrentWeaponAimingStateTicks() {
    // Get base aiming time from current weapon's state data
    WeaponState aimingState = findWeaponState("aiming");
    return aimingState != null ? aimingState.ticks : 30; // Default 30 if not found
}

public boolean isInAimingOrPointingState() {
    String currentState = getCurrentWeaponStateName();
    return "aiming".equals(currentState) || "pointedfromhip".equals(currentState);
}

public boolean isPointingFromHip() {
    return "pointedfromhip".equals(getCurrentWeaponStateName());
}
```

**CombatCalculator Integration:**
```java
// Add method to CombatCalculator to calculate earned bonus
public static AccumulatedAimingBonus calculateEarnedAimingBonus(Character character, long currentTick) {
    if (!character.isInAimingOrPointingState()) return AccumulatedAimingBonus.NONE;
    
    long accumulatedTime = character.getCurrentAimingDuration(currentTick);
    long baseTime = character.getCurrentWeaponAimingStateTicks();
    
    // Apply weapon ready speed multiplier to thresholds
    double weaponReadySpeedMultiplier = character.calculateAimingSpeedMultiplier();
    long adjustedBaseTime = Math.round(baseTime * weaponReadySpeedMultiplier);
    
    // For pointing-from-hip, cap at NORMAL
    if (character.isPointingFromHip()) {
        return accumulatedTime >= adjustedBaseTime ? AccumulatedAimingBonus.NORMAL : AccumulatedAimingBonus.NONE;
    }
    
    // For aiming state, full progression available
    if (accumulatedTime >= adjustedBaseTime * 3) return AccumulatedAimingBonus.VERY_CAREFUL;
    if (accumulatedTime >= adjustedBaseTime * 2) return AccumulatedAimingBonus.CAREFUL;
    if (accumulatedTime >= adjustedBaseTime) return AccumulatedAimingBonus.NORMAL;
    return AccumulatedAimingBonus.NONE;
}

// Modify determineHit to use accumulated bonus
public static HitResult determineHit(Unit attacker, Unit target, ..., long currentTick) {
    // Calculate earned bonus at time of firing
    AccumulatedAimingBonus earnedBonus = calculateEarnedAimingBonus(attacker.character, currentTick);
    
    // Use earned bonus if present, otherwise use selected aiming speed
    double finalAimingModifier;
    boolean useVeryCarefulBenefits = false;
    
    if (earnedBonus != AccumulatedAimingBonus.NONE) {
        // Use only earned bonus when present
        finalAimingModifier = earnedBonus.getAccuracyModifier();
        useVeryCarefulBenefits = earnedBonus.isVeryCareful() && meetsVeryCarefulSkillRequirements(attacker.character);
    } else {
        // Fall back to selected aiming speed
        AimingSpeed selectedSpeed = attacker.character.getCurrentAimingSpeed();
        finalAimingModifier = selectedSpeed.getAccuracyModifier();
        useVeryCarefulBenefits = selectedSpeed.isVeryCareful() && meetsVeryCarefulSkillRequirements(attacker.character);
    }
    
    // For burst fire shots 2+, ignore all aiming modifiers
    if (shotNumber > 1) {
        finalAimingModifier = 0; // Burst penalty applied elsewhere
    }
}

// In Character.scheduleAttackFromCurrentState, add Very Careful random time
AccumulatedAimingBonus earnedBonus = CombatCalculator.calculateEarnedAimingBonus(this, currentTick);
if (earnedBonus == AccumulatedAimingBonus.VERY_CAREFUL && "aiming".equals(currentState)) {
    // Add 2-5 seconds random time, same as selected Very Careful
    long additionalTime = 120 + (long)(Math.random() * 181); // 120-300 ticks
    fireDelay += additionalTime;
}
```

**Console Output Enhancement (Confirmed Format):**
```java
// When earned bonus exists - show earned bonus
"Alice fires a Colt Peacemaker at Bob, shootingfromaiming (aimed 95 ticks, earned Very Careful bonus), at tick 150"
"Charlie fires a Hunting Rifle at Dave, shootingfromhip (pointed 45 ticks, earned Normal bonus), at tick 200"

// When no earned bonus - show selected aiming speed
"Eve fires a Derringer at Frank, shootingfromaiming (aimed 15 ticks, using Quick aiming), at tick 50"
"Dan fires a Hunting Rifle at Eve, shootingfromaiming (aimed 25 ticks, using Normal aiming), at tick 75"
```

#### Edge Cases and Considerations (Confirmed)

**Target Change Handling:**
- All accumulated time is lost when switching targets
- No carryover or quick re-aim bonuses

**Weapon Switch Scenarios:**
- Switching weapons resets accumulated time
- Base timing recalculated for new weapon type

**Movement During Aiming:**
- Movement has no effect on time accumulation
- Movement penalties still apply independently to accuracy
- Character can move freely while accumulating aiming time

**Burst Fire Consideration (Confirmed):**
- Only first shot benefits from accumulated time bonus
- Subsequent burst shots use standard burst penalty only (-20 accuracy)
- No aiming speed modifiers apply to shots 2+ in burst (neither selected nor earned)
- Example: Quick selected + Careful earned = Shot 1: +15, Shot 2+: -20

**Defensive Aiming:**
- Accumulated time bonuses apply normally when finally firing
- No maximum cap or timeout for defensive hold states

**Character Stats Display:**
- No real-time display of accumulated time or potential bonuses
- Bonus information only shown in console output when firing

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files to be Modified**:
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Add timing fields and duration tracking methods
- Firing output generation locations (to be identified during implementation)
- Weapon state transition code (integration with existing progression system)

**New Functionality**:
- Timing capture infrastructure in Character class
- Duration calculation and reporting methods
- Console output enhancement for firing messages

### Data Flow
1. **Timing Capture**: When character enters "aiming" or "pointedfromhip" state, record current tick
2. **Duration Tracking**: Maintain timing throughout state duration, reset on target changes
3. **Firing Integration**: At moment of firing, calculate duration and integrate into console output
4. **State Reset**: Clear timing when transitioning away from aiming/pointing states

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal Overhead**: Simple long field additions with basic arithmetic operations
- **Memory Impact**: Negligible (2 additional long fields per character)
- **Computational Cost**: Minimal (basic tick arithmetic during state transitions and firing)
- **No Performance Regression**: Implementation leverages existing timing infrastructure

Based on the output.txt file, there's a reflection or method resolution error during debug configuration loading:
```
Failed to apply auto-targeting debug configuration: combat.Character.setAutoTargetDebugVisible(boolean)
```

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- Method may not exist or have wrong signature
- Reflection call may be using incorrect class/method name
- Access modifier issues (private method being called via reflection)
- Class loading or initialization timing issues

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Locate Debug Configuration Code**: Find where auto-targeting debug config is applied
2. **Verify Method Existence**: Check if `setAutoTargetDebugVisible(boolean)` exists in Character class
3. **Fix Method Resolution**: Correct reflection call or method signature as needed
4. **Test Configuration**: Ensure debug settings load and apply correctly

#### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Files to Investigate**: Debug configuration loading code, Character.java auto-targeting methods

- **Impact**: Non-critical but affects debugging capabilities
- **Testing**: Verify debug mode toggles work correctly after fix

### âœ… System 5: Immediate Hold State Firing

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Hours**: 2-3 hours

#### Task Checklist
- [x] **Task 5.1**: Analyze current weapon state progression when character is already in hold state
- [x] **Task 5.2**: Implement immediate firing detection when target state equals current state
- [x] **Task 5.3**: Bypass weapon progression delay for characters already in correct state
- [x] **Task 5.4**: Test immediate firing with various hold states (aiming, pointedfromhip, etc.)
- [x] **Task 5.5**: Ensure combat timing and accuracy calculations remain correct

#### Design Specifications

**Issue Analysis:**
From output.txt, Alice was holding at "aiming" state but still went through weapon progression when commanded to fire:
```
Line 66: *** 1000:Alice reached hold state: aiming ***
Line 71: *** 1000:Alice scheduleAttackFromCurrentState: weapon=MP5 Submachine Gun, currentWeaponState=aiming ***
```

Despite being in the target state, there was still a delay before firing (tick 610 to tick 907 = 297 tick delay).

**Expected Behavior:**
- Character already in hold state should fire immediately when commanded
- No weapon state progression should occur if current state = target state
- Combat should commence within 1-2 ticks of command

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. **State Detection**: Check if current weapon state matches desired firing state
2. **Immediate Firing**: Skip weapon progression and fire immediately
3. **Timing Preservation**: Maintain proper aiming duration tracking
4. **Accuracy Consistency**: Ensure accumulated bonuses apply correctly

#### Technical Implementation Notes
- **Key Files**: Character.java weapon state progression and attack scheduling
- **Focus Area**: `scheduleAttackFromCurrentState()` and weapon progression logic
- **Edge Cases**: Handle all hold states (aiming, pointedfromhip, ready, etc.)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Preserve existing behavior for non-hold states

#### Implementation Summary
**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`: Added `isAlreadyInCorrectFiringState()` method and immediate firing logic

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Immediate Firing Detection**: Characters already in correct firing state fire within 1 tick instead of full weapon progression delays
- **State Matching Logic**: Checks if current state matches firing preference (aiming/pointedfromhip)
- **Minimum Duration Safety**: Requires 5+ ticks in current state to prevent abuse during rapid transitions
- **Combat Integration**: Preserves all existing accuracy calculations and accumulated aiming bonuses
- **Debug Output**: Console messages indicate when immediate firing occurs

**Behavioral Changes:**
- **Before**: Characters experienced full weapon state delays even when already in target state (297 ticks in example)
- **After**: Characters fire immediately (1 tick) when already in correct hold state with sufficient duration
- **Preserved**: All combat accuracy, timing, and progression for scenarios requiring normal weapon transitions

### âœ… System 6: Target Switch Aiming State Preservation

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Hours**: 1-2 hours

#### Task Checklist
- [x] **Task 6.1**: Analyze current target switching behavior and weapon state progression logic
- [x] **Task 6.2**: Identify where target switching causes aiming â†’ pointedfromhip regression
- [x] **Task 6.3**: Implement smart target switching that preserves appropriate aiming state
- [x] **Task 6.4**: Reset aiming timing counter for new target while maintaining weapon state
- [x] **Task 6.5**: Test target switching across different weapon states and firing preferences

#### Design Specifications

**Issue Analysis:**
Based on the provided example, when Alice switches from Drake to Bobby after incapacitating Drake, the weapon state progression is:
```
currentWeaponState=ready â†’ pointedfromhip â†’ aiming
```

**Problem Identified:**
- Character was previously aiming at Drake (earned Very Careful bonus from 148 ticks)
- After Drake incapacitation, Alice switches to Bobby
- System forces progression through pointedfromhip state unnecessarily
- Should transition directly: ready â†’ aiming (since character prefers aiming state)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Character already in aiming-capable state should transition directly to aiming for new target
- Aiming timing counter should reset to 0 for new target (correctly implemented)
- No unnecessary regression to pointedfromhip when character's firing preference is aiming
- Preserve existing behavior for characters who prefer pointedfromhip firing

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- Target switching may be using generic weapon progression instead of firing preference-aware progression
- Weapon state reset logic may not consider character's preferred firing state
- Recovery state transitions may default to full weapon progression sequence

#### Technical Implementation Notes

**Files to Investigate:**
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Target switching and weapon state progression logic
- Recovery transition methods after incapacitation/target loss
- Weapon state progression when acquiring new targets

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Locate Target Switch Logic**: Find where target changes trigger weapon state transitions
2. **Analyze State Progression**: Determine why ready state doesn't progress directly to aiming
3. **Implement Smart Progression**: Use firing preference to determine target state for new targets
4. **Preserve Timing Reset**: Maintain existing behavior that resets aiming counters for new targets
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Verify behavior across different weapon states and preferences

**Key Requirements:**
- **Firing Preference Awareness**: Target switching should respect character's firing preference
- **Direct Progression**: Characters preferring aiming should go ready â†’ aiming (not ready â†’ pointedfromhip â†’ aiming)
- **Timing Reset**: Aiming duration counters correctly reset for new targets (already working)
- **State Consistency**: Weapon states should reflect tactical situation, not arbitrary progression
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Preserve existing behavior for pointedfromhip preference characters

#### Edge Cases and Considerations

**Weapon State Scenarios:**
- **From Aiming**: Direct transition to aiming new target with timing reset
- **From Ready**: Progress to preferred firing state (aiming or pointedfromhip) based on preference
- **From Holstered/Slung**: Follow normal progression to preferred state
- **From Recovery**: Transition to preferred state rather than defaulting to pointedfromhip

**Firing Preference Integration:**
- **Aiming Preference**: Target switches should end in aiming state when possible
- **Pointedfromhip Preference**: Target switches should end in pointedfromhip state when possible
- **State Availability**: Respect weapon capabilities (some weapons may not have all states)

**Timing Behavior:**
- **Reset for New Target**: Aiming counters reset to 0 (correctly implemented)
- **Preserve Accumulated Bonuses**: No bonuses carry over between targets (correct behavior)
- **State Duration Tracking**: New timing starts when reaching targeting state for new target

#### Expected Benefits

**Tactical Improvements:**
- **Faster Target Switching**: Eliminates unnecessary weapon state regressions
- **Consistent Behavior**: Weapon states match character's tactical preferences
- **Reduced Delays**: Direct progression reduces time to engage new targets
- **Logical Progression**: Weapon state transitions make tactical sense

**User Experience:**
- **Predictable Behavior**: Characters behave according to their configured preferences
- **Responsive Combat**: Faster target acquisition and engagement
- **Strategic Consistency**: Weapon states reflect intended tactical approach

#### Implementation Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`: Core target switching logic and weapon state selection
- `src/test/java/TargetSwitchingTest.java`: Comprehensive unit tests for target switching behavior

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **getOptimalStateForTargetSwitch()**: Intelligent weapon state selection based on firing preference
- **Smart Target Switching**: Characters transition directly to preferred firing state instead of defaulting to ready
- **Timing Preservation**: Aiming counters reset correctly for new targets while maintaining efficient state progression
- **Firing Preference Integration**: Aiming preference characters go directly to aiming, pointedfromhip preference characters go to pointedfromhip
- **Fallback Logic**: Robust fallback system handles weapons without specific states
- **startTimingForTargetSwitchState()**: Automatic timing start when transitioning to targeting states

**Behavioral Changes:**
- **Before**: Target switching always reset to ready state, causing ready â†’ pointedfromhip â†’ aiming progression
- **After**: Target switching respects firing preference, enabling direct ready â†’ aiming or ready â†’ pointedfromhip progression
- **Preserved**: All existing timing reset behavior and accuracy calculations for new targets

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Modified startAttackSequence()**: Two target switching scenarios now use intelligent state selection
- **Package-Private Methods**: Testing-accessible methods for validation of target switching logic
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests verify behavior across different firing preferences and weapon states

Current firing output format:
```
1000:Alice fires a MP5 Submachine Gun at 1005:Frank, shootingfromaiming (aimed 30 ticks, earned Normal bonus), at tick 482
```

**Expected Behavior:**
Firing output should include ammunition information:
```
1000:Alice fires a MP5 Submachine Gun at 1005:Frank, shootingfromaiming (aimed 30 ticks, earned Normal bonus), [ammo: 25/30], at tick 482
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Ammunition Access**: Determine how to access current ammunition count from weapon

- **Unlimited Ammunition**: Handle weapons with infinite or untracked ammunition gracefully
- **Empty Weapons**: Display zero ammunition correctly (e.g., [ammo: 0/30])
- **Reloading States**: Ensure ammunition display reflects current state

**Output Integration:**
- **Placement**: Position ammunition display logically within existing message structure
- **Timing Integration**: Maintain compatibility with aiming duration and bonus displays
- **Burst Fire**: Show ammunition count for each shot in burst sequences
- **Console Clarity**: Ensure ammunition display doesn't interfere with existing information

#### Expected Benefits
