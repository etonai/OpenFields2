- **Mixed Engagements**: Complex scenarios with simultaneous ranged and melee combat
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Rich visual and audio feedback for all combat states

### 7. Visual Angle Modifier System ‚è≥ **PLANNED** (Phase 7)
- [ ] **Geometric Visual Angle Calculation**
  - [ ] Implement isosceles triangle model for target size calculation
  - [ ] Calculate visual angle based on target width and distance
  - [ ] Create visual angle to accuracy modifier conversion system
  - [ ] Integrate with existing 7 pixels = 1 foot coordinate system

- [ ] **Two-Layer Modifier Integration**
  - [ ] Preserve existing weapon-based range modifiers (weapon accuracy, projectile drop)
  - [ ] Add new human vision-based visual angle modifiers (target acquisition, visual acuity)
  - [ ] Combine both modifier types in final hit calculation
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with current combat mechanics

- [ ] **Character and Equipment Integration**
  - [ ] Consider integration with Dexterity and marksmanship skills
  - [ ] Design equipment effects (scopes, optics) for visual angle enhancement
  - [ ] Implement character stat modifiers for visual targeting ability
  - [ ] Add visual angle information to targeting UI interface

**Visual Angle System Features:**
- **Geometric Model**: Eyeball as point, target as line segment in isosceles triangle
- **Target Standardization**: Use 3-foot character width for consistent calculations
- **Angular Scaling**: Larger visual angles = easier shots, smaller angles = harder shots
- **Dual Modifier System**: Weapon characteristics + human vision factors
- **Equipment Enhancement**: Scopes effectively increase target's visual angle
- **Skill Integration**: Marksmanship skills affect visual angle penalty sensitivity

**Example Visual Angle Calculations:**
```java
double targetWidth = 3.0; // feet (character width)
double distance = getDistanceToTarget();
double visualAngle = Math.toDegrees(2 * Math.atan(targetWidth / (2 * distance)));
int visualAngleModifier = calculateVisualAngleModifier(visualAngle);
int totalModifier = weaponRangeModifier + visualAngleModifier + otherModifiers;
```

**Distance vs Visual Angle Examples:**
- **Close Range** (10 feet): 3-foot target ‚âà 17¬∞ angular size (very easy)
- **Medium Range** (50 feet): 3-foot target ‚âà 3.4¬∞ angular size (moderate)
- **Long Range** (200 feet): 3-foot target ‚âà 0.9¬∞ angular size (very difficult)
- **Extreme Range** (500 feet): 3-foot target ‚âà 0.3¬∞ angular size (nearly impossible)
