### Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Coordinator Pattern
InputManager now serves as a **pure coordinator** rather than implementing business logic:
```java
// Before DevCycle 15h
private void handleCharacterCreation() {
    // 200+ lines of character creation logic
}

// After DevCycle 15h  
private void handleCharacterCreation() {
    characterCreationController.handleCharacterCreation();
}
```

#### 2. Dependency Injection Pattern
All components are injected via constructor, enabling clean separation:
```java
public InputManager(List<Unit> units, SelectionManager selectionManager, 
                   GameRenderer gameRenderer, GameClock gameClock,
                   PriorityQueue<ScheduledEvent> eventQueue, Canvas canvas,
                   InputManagerCallbacks callbacks) {
    // 13 specialized components initialized via dependency injection
}
```

#### 3. Delegation Pattern
Complex operations delegate to specialized controllers:
```java
// Lifecycle management delegated to system integrator
public void initializeComponents() {
    systemIntegrator.initializeComponents();
}

// Utility operations delegated to InputUtils
private void processCharacterData(CharacterData data) {
    Character character = InputUtils.convertFromCharacterData(data);
}
```

## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Core Dependencies (Lines 156-225)
**Current State**: 23 final field dependencies
- **Core Game Systems**: units, selectionManager, gameRenderer, gameClock, eventQueue, canvas
- **Component Architecture**: 13 specialized components from DevCycle 15e/15h
- **Integration**: systemIntegrator, callbacks for main game communication

**Assessment**: Well-organized dependency structure with clear separation of concerns.

### 2. Constructor and Initialization (Lines 338-398)
**Current State**: Constructor with 7 parameters, initializes 13 components
- **Dependency Injection**: All components created and wired in constructor
- **System Integration**: InputSystemIntegrator coordinates all components
- **Lifecycle Setup**: Debug callbacks and component coordination established

**Assessment**: Clean initialization pattern with proper component wiring.

### 3. Component Lifecycle Management (Lines 406-483)
**Current State**: Delegated to InputSystemIntegrator
```java
public void initializeComponents() {
    systemIntegrator.initializeComponents();
}

public boolean validateComponentIntegrity() {
    return systemIntegrator.validateComponentIntegrity();
}
```

**Assessment**: Excellent separation - lifecycle complexity removed from InputManager.

### 4. Input Event Processing (Lines 520-850)
**Current State**: Delegation to specialized handlers
- **Mouse Events**: Delegated to MouseInputHandler
- **Keyboard Events**: Delegated to KeyboardInputHandler  
- **Camera Controls**: Delegated to CameraController
- **Movement**: Delegated to MovementController

**Assessment**: Clean event routing with specialized handlers.

### 5. Workflow Management (Lines 1480-1750)
**Current State**: Delegation to workflow controllers
- **Character Creation**: CharacterCreationController
- **Deployment**: DeploymentController  
- **Victory Processing**: VictoryOutcomeController

**Assessment**: Complex workflows properly extracted and delegated.

## Strengths of Current Architecture
