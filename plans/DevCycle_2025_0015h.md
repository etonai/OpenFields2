# InputManager File Splitting - DevCycle 2025_0015h
*Created: June 22, 2025 | Last Implementation Update: June 22, 2025 | Implementation Status: Phase 2.1 Complete*

## Overview
DevCycle 15h implements a comprehensive file splitting strategy for InputManager.java, reducing it from 3,749 lines to a manageable coordinator (~800-1000 lines) while extracting functionality into 10+ focused, specialized files. This builds on the successful component-based architecture established in DevCycle 15e.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- **Reduce InputManager.java**: From 3,749 lines to ~800-1000 lines (coordinator role)
- **Improve Maintainability**: Split into 10+ focused files with clear responsibilities  
- **Preserve Functionality**: 100% backward compatibility with existing systems
- **Enhance Developer Productivity**: Easier navigation, debugging, and feature development

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15e component architecture must be functional
- InputStateTracker, EditModeManager, GameStateManager integration preserved
- All existing input workflows must continue functioning

**Estimated Complexity:** High - Systematic refactoring of 3,749-line monolith file requiring careful dependency management
