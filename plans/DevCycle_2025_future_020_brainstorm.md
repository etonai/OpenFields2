*Created: June 16, 2025*
*Analysis Reference: [InputManager_Refactoring_Analysis.md](../analysis/InputManager_Refactoring_Analysis.md)*

## **DevCycle 12 - InputManager Architecture Refactoring**
**Focus**: Breaking down the monolithic 2,632-line InputManager class into maintainable, testable components

## **Core Problem Statement**

The `InputManager.java` file has become the largest file in the codebase at 2,632 lines, creating significant maintainability challenges:

- **Single Responsibility Violations**: One class handling 8+ distinct areas of functionality
- **Testing Difficulties**: Hard to unit test individual features due to tight coupling
- **Development Bottlenecks**: Merge conflicts and parallel development issues
- **Bug Isolation Problems**: Issues difficult to trace and fix within monolithic structure
- **Performance Concerns**: Unnecessary processing for inactive functionality areas

## **Refactoring Vision**

Transform the monolithic InputManager into **8 focused components** averaging 200-400 lines each:

### **Component Architecture**

#### **1. InputEventHandlers** (~200-250 lines)
**Pure input processing and validation**
- Raw mouse/keyboard event processing
- Input validation and normalization  
- Event routing decisions
- Minimal business logic dependencies

#### **2. InputStateManager** (~150-200 lines)
**Centralized state management**
- All `waitingFor...` boolean flags consolidated
- State transition validation and consistency
- Single source of truth for input state
- State history for debugging

#### **3. UnitCommandProcessor** (~300-400 lines)
**Unit control and combat commands**

- Event delegation to appropriate systems
- High-level state orchestration
- Simplified public interface

## **Migration Strategy Phases**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Components (Week 1-2)**
**Establish core infrastructure**
- Extract `InputEventHandlers` for basic input processing
- Create `InputStateManager` with centralized state flags
- Update existing InputManager to delegate basic operations
- **Risk Level**: Low - Basic input processing with clear interfaces

### **Phase 2: Command Processing (Week 3-4)**
**Move unit control logic**
- Extract `UnitCommandProcessor` with all unit manipulation
- Migrate movement, aiming, and combat command processing
- Implement command validation and execution
- **Risk Level**: Medium - Core gameplay functionality

### **Phase 3: Workflow Systems (Week 5-6)**
**Complex multi-step processes**
- Extract `EditModeManager` for character creation workflows
- Create `DeploymentSystem` for formation placement
- Implement proper state transitions and validation
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High - Complex workflows with many state dependencies

### **Phase 4: Game Management (Week 7-8)**
**State persistence and display**
- Extract `GameStateManager` for save/load operations
- Create `InputDisplaySystem` for UI feedback
- Finalize component interfaces and interactions
- **Risk Level**: Medium - File I/O and display logic

### **Phase 5: Final Integration (Week 9-10)**
**Complete the transformation**
- Refactor remaining InputManager as lightweight coordinator
- Optimize component interactions and performance
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- **Risk Level**: Low - Coordination and optimization

## **Technical Implementation Considerations**

### **Component Communication Patterns**
**Event-Driven Architecture**
- Components communicate through well-defined events
- Minimal direct dependencies between components
- Central event bus or mediator pattern for coordination

**State Synchronization**
- InputStateManager owns all state flags
- Components query state rather than maintain copies
- Clear state ownership boundaries

**Interface Design**
- Each component exposes minimal, focused public interface
- Dependency injection for component initialization
- Mock-friendly interfaces for testing

### **Backwards Compatibility Strategy**
**Adapter Pattern During Migration**
- Maintain existing public InputManager interface
- Gradually migrate internal implementation to components
- Rollback capability at each phase

**Incremental Testing**
- Each phase maintains full functionality
- Regression testing after each component extraction
- Performance benchmarking throughout migration

### **Performance Considerations**
**Selective Event Processing**
- Only active components process relevant events
- Event routing eliminates unnecessary processing
- Component lifecycle management for memory efficiency

**State Caching and Optimization**
- Centralized state management enables optimization
- Cached state queries for frequently accessed information
- Lazy initialization for unused components

## **Integration Points and Dependencies**

### **External System Dependencies**
**Current InputManager Dependencies** (to be distributed):
- `units` (List<Unit>) → UnitCommandProcessor
- `selectionManager` → UnitCommandProcessor, InputDisplaySystem  
- `gameRenderer` → InputDisplaySystem
- `gameClock` → GameStateManager
- `eventQueue` → UnitCommandProcessor, GameStateManager
- `canvas` → InputEventHandlers, InputDisplaySystem
- `SaveGameManager` → GameStateManager
- `UniversalCharacterRegistry` → EditModeManager, DeploymentSystem

### **Callback Interface Refactoring**
**Current Callback Consolidation**:
- Game control callbacks → GameStateManager
- Unit manipulation callbacks → UnitCommandProcessor
- Display update callbacks → InputDisplaySystem
- Edit mode callbacks → EditModeManager

## **Benefits and Success Metrics**

- Regression test suite for each phase
- Parallel development of tests with components

## **Design Questions and Decisions**

### **Component Communication**
1. **Event Bus vs Direct Communication**: Event bus for loose coupling vs direct calls for performance?
2. **State Management**: Single centralized state vs distributed component state?
3. **Error Handling**: Component-level error handling vs centralized error management?

### **Migration Approach**
1. **Big Bang vs Incremental**: Complete rewrite vs gradual component extraction?
2. **Interface Stability**: Maintain existing interfaces vs clean slate redesign?
3. **Testing Strategy**: Component testing first vs integration testing focus?

### **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection vs setter injection vs service locator?
2. **Component Lifecycle**: Singleton components vs factory-created instances?
3. **Configuration**: Hard-coded configuration vs external configuration files?

## **Next Steps for DevCycle 10 Planning**

1. **Finalize component interfaces** and communication patterns
2. **Create detailed migration plan** with specific implementation tasks
3. **Set up testing infrastructure** for component isolation and integration
4. **Design event communication system** between components
5. **Plan backwards compatibility strategy** and rollback procedures
6. **Create performance benchmark suite** for before/after comparison
7. **Develop comprehensive integration tests** for each migration phase

## **Success Vision**

By the end of DevCycle 10:
- **InputManager.java reduced to <300 lines** as a lightweight coordinator
- **8 focused components** with clear, single responsibilities
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all input functionality
- **Improved development velocity** with parallel development capability
- **Foundation for future enhancements** with clear extension points
