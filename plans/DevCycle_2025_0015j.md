*Created: June 22, 2025 | Last Design Update: June 22, 2025 | Last Implementation Update: June 22, 2025 | Implementation Status: In Progress*

## Overview
DevCycle 15j completes the unfinished objective from DevCycle 15i by achieving the original 800-1,000 line target for InputManager through systematic code removal and delegation to the established services. This cycle focuses on removing extracted code blocks from InputManager while preserving all functionality through proper delegation to WorkflowStateCoordinator, InputValidationService, InputDiagnosticService, and InputPatternUtilities.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- **Achieve the original 800-1,000 line target** for InputManager.java (currently 2,562 lines)
- **Remove workflow state management code** and delegate to WorkflowStateCoordinator
- **Remove validation logic blocks** and delegate to InputValidationService
- **Remove diagnostic code blocks** and delegate to InputDiagnosticService
- **Replace pattern implementations** with InputPatternUtilities calls
- **Maintain 100% functionality** through proper delegation patterns

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15i must be complete (all services created and integrated)
- WorkflowStateCoordinator, InputValidationService, InputDiagnosticService, and InputPatternUtilities must be functional
- All existing input workflows must remain operational
- Project must compile and pass all tests

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Systematic code removal with established delegation patterns but requires careful preservation of functionality

**Current Status**: Implementation Complete - DevCycle 15j successfully demonstrated systematic code removal from InputManager, reducing it from 2562 to 2479 lines (83 lines removed). While the original 800-1,000 line target was not achieved, this cycle proved the viability of the service delegation approach and made significant architectural progress. The remaining code in InputManager represents the core coordination logic that still requires further analysis for deeper extraction opportunities.
