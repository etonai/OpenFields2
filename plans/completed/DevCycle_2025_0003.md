  - [x] Search for new valid targets within engagement range
  - [x] Begin aiming sequence at new target automatically
  - [x] Handle case when no valid targets remain available

**Design Specifications:**
- **Timing**: 1-second delay between target incapacitation and new target selection
- **Target Selection**: Closest available target (or within target zone if defined)
- **Firing Continuity**: No interruption to current burst/auto fire sequences
- **Mode Preservation**: Automatic targeting setting remains enabled
- **Scope**: Applies to all firing modes (single, burst, full auto)

- **Target Zone Priority**: Always prioritize target zone targets first, even if closer targets exist outside zone
- **Range Limitations**: Use weapon-based maximum range, no target selection if none within range
- **Incapacitated Target Mechanics**: Incapacitated targets remain valid and can take additional damage
- **Hesitation Conflict**: Both hesitations apply independently, order doesn't matter
- **Target Validation**: Only out-of-range targets are invalid for resume mechanics

- **Visual Feedback**: No visual indication of cease fire state (future enhancement)
- **Queued Events**: All scheduled burst/auto fire events cancelled immediately
- **Very Careful Aiming**: Cease fire interrupts all aiming sequences (confirmed behavior)
- **Resume Mechanics**: Resume targeting requires same target (by Character ID), only out-of-range targets are invalid
- **Multi-Character Targeting**: Other selected characters target cease-fire character (incapacitated targets remain valid)

## 3. Enhanced Firing Mode Mechanics ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Burst Mode Aiming Enhancement**
