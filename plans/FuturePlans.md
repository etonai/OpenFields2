# OpenFields2 Future Plans and Vision
*Created: June 14, 2025*

## **Vision Overview**

OpenFields2 is evolving from a tactical combat simulator into a rich campaign system with persistent characters, experience growth, and narrative-driven scenarios. This document outlines the long-term vision and development roadmap for transforming OF2 into a character-driven campaign system.

## **The Grand Vision: From Simulator to Campaign System**

Your vision transforms OF2 from a tactical simulator into a character-driven campaign system where:
- Characters persist across multiple battles and scenarios
- Survivors gain experience and develop unique histories
- Famous historical and fictional scenarios can be recreated
- The system serves as a combat resolver for broader RPG campaigns

## **Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Battle of Testing Fields** (Civil War Recreation)
**Vision**: Set up a civil war recreation with 40 characters
- 40 characters (20 Union soldiers vs 20 Confederate soldiers)
- Formation-based combat setup with opposing lines
- Survival-based experience determination
- First large-scale battle scenario

### **Phase 2: Post-Battle Progression**
**Vision**: Survivors grow and develop over time
- Survivors gain experience and skill improvements
- Wound healing mechanics over time
- Character persistence across multiple battles
- Career tracking for individual characters

### **Phase 3: Expanded Scenarios**
**Vision**: Beyond civil war into diverse combat scenarios
- Mixed historical/fictional battles
- Bank robbery scenarios with objectives
- Individual heroic characters emerging from previous battles
- Gunfights between Battle of Testing Fields survivors vs new characters

### **Phase 4: Cinematic Recreation**
**Vision**: Recreate famous movie and historical gunfights
- Character creation based on movie personas (Tombstone, Open Range, Unforgiven)
- Custom stat assignment for specific famous characters
- Scenario-specific setups and victory conditions
- Wild west style single combat scenarios
- Cattle drive defense scenarios (cowboys vs cattle rustlers)

### **Phase 5: RPG Integration**
**Vision**: OF2 as combat resolver for broader tabletop RPG
- Character import/export for external campaigns
- Integration with tabletop role-playing games
- Combat resolution for RPG scenarios
- Character persistence between computer and tabletop sessions

## **Development Cycle Mapping**

### **DevCycle 8 - Foundation Building: Scenario System**
**Focus**: Create the infrastructure for large-scale scenarios
- **Scenario definition and loading system**
- **Multi-character batch creation tools**
- **Formation setup and positioning tools**
- **Victory/defeat condition framework**
- **Basic Battle of Testing Fields implementation**

### **DevCycle 9 - Character Progression: Experience & Skills**
**Focus**: Post-battle character development
- **Post-battle experience calculation system**
- **Skill advancement mechanics**
- **Character archive/roster management**
- **Battle history tracking**

### **DevCycle 10 - Campaign Features: Persistence & Healing**
**Focus**: Long-term character management
- **Time-based wound recovery system**
- **Character career tracking across battles**
- **Battle history and achievement logging**
- **Character retirement and veteran status**

### **Future Development Cycles**
- **Scenario Editor**: Custom battle creation tools
- **Character Templates**: Pre-made famous gunfighters and movie characters
- **Advanced Scenarios**: Objective-based missions beyond pure elimination
- **RPG Integration Tools**: Import/export systems for external campaigns
- **Historical Battle Library**: Pre-made famous battles and scenarios

## **Key Questions for DevCycle 8**

### **Foundation Approach**
1. **Should we start with the scenario system foundation?** (Character batch creation, formation setup)
2. **Or focus on the experience/skill progression system first?** (So survivors can grow)
3. **How complex should the initial "Battle of Testing Fields" be?** (Simple line-up vs. more tactical positioning)

### **Technical Considerations**
- **Character Scale**: Can the current system handle 40 simultaneous characters?
- **Performance**: What optimizations are needed for large battles?
- **Save System**: How to handle persistent character rosters vs individual scenarios?
- **UI Scaling**: How to manage and display large numbers of characters effectively?

### **Design Decisions**
- **Formation Setup**: Manual positioning vs predefined formations?
- **Victory Conditions**: Last side standing vs objective-based?
- **Experience Calculation**: Simple survival vs performance-based?
- **Character Naming**: Procedural generation vs manual assignment?

## **Long-Term Strategic Value**

This vision transforms OF2 from a tactical simulator into:
- **Character-Driven Narrative Engine**: Where individual stories emerge from combat
- **Historical Recreation Tool**: For exploring famous battles and scenarios
- **RPG Combat Resolver**: Bridging computer simulation and tabletop gaming
- **Creative Playground**: For experimenting with "what if" scenarios

## **Success Metrics**

- **Phase 1 Success**: Successfully run Battle of Testing Fields with 40 characters
- **Phase 2 Success**: Characters persist and grow across multiple battles
- **Phase 3 Success**: Diverse scenarios beyond civil war battles
- **Phase 4 Success**: Recreation of recognizable movie/historical scenes
- **Phase 5 Success**: Seamless integration with external RPG campaigns

## **Next Steps**

The immediate focus should be on **DevCycle 8: Foundation Building** to create the scenario system infrastructure that enables the Battle of Testing Fields. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent phases of the vision.

The question remains: **Which foundation piece excites you most to start with?**
