# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0037
*Created: 2025-07-02 at 2:59 PM PDT | Last Design Update: 2025-07-02 at 2:59 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: [Date] at [Time] | Implementation Status: Ready for System 1 Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on implementing multiple varied tasks to improve system stability, fix critical bugs, and enhance game mechanics. The cycle will address several independent issues and improvements identified through testing and analysis.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **⚠️ CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Update CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development cycle tracking and plan document location information
- Implement additional system improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 36 successfully completed and merged
- All existing tests passing
- Clean working directory

**Estimated Complexity:** Low - Documentation update with file analysis and structured information organization

### 2. Target Switch Delay After Incapacitation ✅ **COMPLETE**
*Implement a reflexes-modified delay when characters switch targets after incapacitating an opponent in auto-targeting mode.*

**IMPLEMENTATION DECISION**: After thorough analysis and implementation, the target switch delay system was removed in favor of a simplified reaiming state approach. The 15-tick reaiming state provides sufficient target acquisition delay without the complexity of reflexes-modified timing calculations.

**SYSTEM EVOLUTION**: 
- **Original Plan**: Complex reflexes-modified delay with cancellation logic and state management
- **Implementation Discovery**: Target switch delay added unnecessary complexity to auto-targeting system
- **Final Solution**: Simple 15-tick reaiming state triggered on target incapacitation
- **User Feedback**: "Now that we have reaiming it is enough" - confirmed removal of target switch delay

- [x] **Target Incapacitation Detection**
  - [x] ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AS REAIMING**: Target incapacitation detection implemented in AutoTargetingSystem
  - [x] ✅ **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Replaced complex delay system with 15-tick reaiming state
  - [x] ✅ **SINGLE TRIGGER**: First incapacitation only logic prevents reaiming stacking
  - [x] ✅ **AUTO-TARGETING INTEGRATION**: Seamless integration with existing CombatCoordinator

- [x] **Reaiming State Implementation (Replaced Delay System)**
  - [x] ✅ **FIXED 15-TICK DURATION**: Simple 15-tick reaiming state provides target acquisition delay
  - [x] ✅ **NO REFLEXES COMPLEXITY**: Eliminated reflexes modifier calculations for simpler implementation
  - [x] ✅ **WEAPON STATE INTEGRATION**: Reaiming state integrated with existing weapon state system
  - [x] ✅ **TARGET STATE PRESERVATION**: Reaiming returns to previous state (aiming/pointedfromhip)
  - [x] ✅ **TIMING RESET**: Clears existing aiming timing when reaiming state created

- [x] **State Management and Visual Display**
  - [x] ✅ **MANUAL OVERRIDE**: Existing manual target assignment cancellation preserved
  - [x] ✅ **MOVEMENT CANCELLATION**: Movement orders properly cancel auto-targeting
  - [x] ✅ **WEAPON STATE SEPARATION**: Reaiming integrated as weapon state, not separate system
  - [x] ✅ **VISUAL FIX**: Reaiming weapons now display in aiming position, not ready position
  - [x] ✅ **RENDER STATE UPDATE**: WeaponRenderState updated to include "reaiming" in attacking states

### 3. Combat Message Output Cleanup ✅ **COMPLETE**
*Remove inappropriate "headshot" references from combat output and ensure consistent terminology throughout the combat system.*

- [x] **Combat Output Analysis**
  - [x] ✅ **IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS**: Found inappropriate references in CombatResolver.java and OpenFields2.java
  - [x] ✅ **REVIEWED MESSAGING**: Analyzed current damage and incapacitation messaging patterns
  - [x] ✅ **FOUND INAPPROPRIATE REFERENCES**: Located "HEADSHOT KILL!" messages and "headshotsKills" field
  - [x] ✅ **DOCUMENTED PATTERNS**: Catalogued inconsistent terminology usage

- [x] **Message Terminology Standardization**
  - [x] ✅ **REPLACED KILL REFERENCES**: Changed "HEADSHOT KILL!" to incapacitation messaging
  - [x] ✅ **REMOVED HEADSHOT EMPHASIS**: Eliminated special emphasis on headshot outcomes
  - [x] ✅ **STANDARDIZED DAMAGE REPORTING**: Consistent format across all combat output
  - [x] ✅ **UNIFIED INCAPACITATION MESSAGING**: Standard terminology across ranged and melee combat

- [x] **Combat Feedback Enhancement**
  - [x] ✅ **REVIEWED HIT/MISS MESSAGING**: Verified clarity and consistency of all combat messages
  - [x] ✅ **CONFIRMED DAMAGE REPORTING**: All damage values clearly reported without inappropriate emphasis
  - [x] ✅ **VERIFIED INCAPACITATION EVENTS**: Proper announcement of incapacitation without "kill" terminology
  - [x] ✅ **TESTED MESSAGE OUTPUT**: Validated consistency across pistol, rifle, and melee weapon scenarios

**Design Specifications:**
- **Terminology Consistency**: Use "incapacitation" not "kill" throughout combat output
- **No Headshot Emphasis**: Remove any special callouts for headshot damage or hits
- **Damage Reporting**: Clear, consistent format for damage dealt and health remaining
- **Incapacitation Messages**: Standard messaging when characters reach 0 health
- **Hit/Miss Clarity**: Consistent messaging for successful hits vs. misses
- **Weapon Neutrality**: Same message format regardless of weapon type used

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - Combat message generation locations in combat system
  - Any console output or logging related to combat results
  - Damage application and incapacitation detection code
- **Message Format Standardization**: Establish consistent patterns for all combat output
- **Output Review**: Search codebase for inappropriate terminology and replace

### Lessons Learned
*[To be completed after each system implementation]*

**System 1 Lessons:**
- **Documentation Maintenance Importance**: Manual cycle tracking requires systematic workflow integration to prevent information drift
- **Path Validation Critical**: All documented file paths must be verified during implementation to ensure accuracy
- **Workflow Enhancement Value**: Adding procedures to existing workflow documents prevents future oversight

**System 2 Lessons:**
- **Simplification Over Complexity**: The original complex reflexes-modified delay system was unnecessarily complicated; the simple 15-tick reaiming state achieved the same goal
- **User Feedback Validation**: User confirmation that "reaiming is enough" validated the decision to remove the target switch delay system
- **Visual State Consistency**: Weapon rendering states must match logical weapon states (reaiming should appear as aiming, not ready)
- **Test Evolution**: Converting tests from complex delay timing to simple reaiming behavior verification improved test maintainability
- **Code Removal Benefits**: Removing unnecessary fields and methods simplified the codebase while preserving core functionality

**System 3 Lessons:**
- **Comprehensive Search Importance**: Using grep to systematically find all inappropriate terminology ensures nothing is missed
- **Data Layer Consistency**: Terminology changes must propagate through all layers including persistence, JSON, and test data
- **User Feedback Responsiveness**: Addressing inappropriate emphasis in output improves game tone and user experience
- **Field Naming Conventions**: Consistent field naming across code and data prevents confusion and JSON loading errors

## 🔄 CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ✅ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ❌ **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ✅ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ⭕ **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- 🚫 **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ✅ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

## ⚠️ ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ⚠️

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

---

*This iterative development cycle focuses on implementing one system at a time while maintaining flexibility for additional improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*

## Planning Questions for User Review

Based on my comprehensive review of System 2 planning, I have identified several areas requiring clarification before implementation can proceed:

### Technical Implementation Questions

1. **Target Switch Delay Scope**: Should the 15-tick delay apply to ALL automatic target switches (including when targets move out of range, become obstructed, etc.) or only when the current target becomes incapacitated?
   
   **Recommendation**: Apply delay ONLY when the current target becomes incapacitated. Other target switches (range, obstruction, zone changes) should remain immediate for responsive gameplay. Incapacitation specifically represents the cognitive processing time needed to recognize "target down, need new target."
- Please follow the recommendation

2. **Delay Formula Clarification**: The current design specifies `targetSwitchDelay = 15 ticks × reflexesSpeedMultiplier`. However, the existing reflexes system uses `1.0 - (reflexesModifier * 0.015)` where lower values mean faster. For target switch delays, should:
   - Lower reflexes = longer delay (more confusion when target goes down)?
   - Higher reflexes = shorter delay (faster target reacquisition)?
   - What specific scaling factor should be used (0.015 like weapon readying, or different)?

   **Recommendation**: Use the same formula pattern as weapon readying for consistency: `targetSwitchDelay = 15 × (1.0 - (reflexesModifier * 0.015))`. Higher reflexes = shorter delay (faster target reacquisition). This maintains system consistency and intuitive stat behavior where higher reflexes always means faster reactions.
- Please follow the recommendation

3. **Delay State Management**: During the target switch delay period, what should happen if:
   - The character is manually given a new target?
   - The character is ordered to move or perform another action?
   - A new enemy appears closer than the queued next target?
   - The character takes damage or is attacked during the delay?

   **Recommendation**: Manual actions should immediately cancel the delay (player control overrides auto-targeting). Movement orders should cancel the delay. New closer enemies should NOT interrupt the delay (prevents overly complex priority recalculation). Taking damage should NOT cancel the delay (maintains realism of processing time).
- Please follow the recommendation

4. **Integration with Existing Combat States**: Should target switch delays be:
   - Separate from weapon state timing (can overlap with aiming/reloading)?
   - Integrated with existing combat state machine?
   - Cancelled by certain weapon states (like reloading or recovering)?

   **Recommendation**: Keep target switch delays separate from weapon states - they represent mental processing, not physical weapon manipulation. Allow overlap with aiming/reloading. Do NOT cancel delays for weapon states - the character can reload while mentally processing target selection.
- Please follow the recommendation

5. **Multiple Target Incapacitation**: If the character incapacitates multiple targets in rapid succession (burst fire, multiple projectiles), should:
   - Each incapacitation trigger a separate delay?
   - Only the first incapacitation trigger the delay?
   - The delay reset with each new incapacitation?

   **Recommendation**: Only the first incapacitation triggers the delay. Subsequent incapacitations during the delay period should not reset or extend it. This prevents excessive delays from burst fire while maintaining the core realism benefit.
- Please follow the recommendation

### User Experience Questions

6. **Delay Timing Feedback**: Should there be any visual or audio feedback during the target switch delay to indicate the character is "processing" the target change?

   **Recommendation**: No additional feedback for initial implementation. The delay itself is the feedback - players will notice the more realistic timing. Adding visual/audio cues could be considered in future enhancements but would complicate the initial implementation unnecessarily.
- Please follow the recommendation

7. **Delay Duration Balancing**: Is 15 ticks (0.25 seconds) the correct base duration, or should this be:
   - Longer for more noticeable realism (30-45 ticks)?
   - Shorter for better gameplay flow (5-10 ticks)?
   - Configurable through game settings?

   **Recommendation**: Start with 15 ticks (0.25 seconds) as specified in the original request. This is noticeable enough to address the unrealistic instant switching but short enough to maintain gameplay flow. Avoid configurability in initial implementation - keep it simple and adjust based on testing feedback.
- Please follow the recommendation

### System Integration Questions

8. **Quickdraw Skill Integration**: Should the Quickdraw skill (currently used for weapon readying speed) also affect target switch delays, or should delays only use reflexes modifiers?

   **Recommendation**: Use only reflexes modifiers for target switch delays. Quickdraw represents physical weapon manipulation speed, while target switching represents mental/perceptual processing. Keep the systems conceptually separate to maintain clear stat purposes and avoid overly complex calculations.
- Please follow the recommendation

9. **Weapon-Specific Delays**: Should different weapon types have different base target switch delays:
   - Submachine guns: faster target switching due to closer combat?
   - Rifles: slower target switching due to precision requirements?
   - Or should all weapons use the same base 15-tick delay?

   **Recommendation**: Use the same base 15-tick delay for all weapons. Target switching delay represents mental processing time, not weapon-specific factors. This keeps the implementation simple and focuses on the core reflexes-based modification. Weapon-specific variations could be considered in future enhancements.
- Please follow the recommendation

10. **Auto-Targeting Zone Priority**: When the delay expires and the system needs to find a new target, should it:
    - Use the same zone priority system as currently implemented?
    - Prefer targets that were "next closest" when the delay started?
    - Re-evaluate all targets fresh when the delay completes?

    **Recommendation**: Use the existing zone priority system for consistency with current auto-targeting behavior. Re-evaluate all targets fresh when the delay completes - this ensures the character gets the best target available at that moment, not outdated target selection from when the delay started.
- Please follow the recommendation

### Implementation Priority Questions

11. **Minimum Viable Implementation**: For initial implementation, should we:
    - Start with a simple fixed delay (no reflexes modifier) to prove the concept?
    - Implement the full reflexes-modified system immediately?
    - Add configurability for testing different delay values?

    **Recommendation**: Implement the full reflexes-modified system immediately. The reflexes calculation is well-established and straightforward to implement. Starting with a fixed delay would require implementing the same integration points and then modifying them, creating unnecessary rework.
- Please follow the recommendation

12. **Testing Validation**: What specific scenarios should be tested to validate the implementation:
    - The exact analysis/output.txt scenario with Alice vs. Drake/Bobby/Frank?
    - Multi-target burst fire scenarios?
    - Mixed manual and auto-targeting scenarios?
    - Different reflexes values for timing validation?

    **Recommendation**: Test all listed scenarios in priority order: (1) The exact analysis/output.txt scenario to verify the core problem is solved, (2) Different reflexes values to validate modifier calculations, (3) Manual targeting override to ensure player control works, (4) Burst fire scenarios to verify single-delay behavior. This provides comprehensive validation while focusing on the primary use case first.
