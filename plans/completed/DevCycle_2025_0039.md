*Created: 2025-07-03 at 9:23 AM | Last Design Update: 2025-07-03 at 9:23 AM | Last Implementation Update: N/A | Implementation Status: ⭕ PLANNING*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on rebuilding the HeadlessGunfightTest to use the actual game's combat system instead of mock combat events. The current test provides false confidence by testing predetermined outcomes rather than validating real game mechanics. This cycle will create a proper headless test that mirrors GunfightTestAutomated exactly, but without JavaFX UI dependencies.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Replace fake combat simulation with real CombatCoordinator and game mechanics
- Enable OpenFields2 to run in headless mode using TestPlatform
- Achieve test parity between HeadlessGunfightTest and GunfightTestAutomated
- Maintain fast execution while testing actual combat rules

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 36 Headless Testing Architecture must be complete
- TestPlatform must be functional and integrated
- All critical tests (GunfightTestAutomated, etc.) must be passing

**Estimated Complexity:** High - Requires significant refactoring of game initialization and combat system integration

## Planning Questions for User Review

**USER DECISION: Accept all recommendations provided below.**

### Technical Architecture Questions
1. **Headless Mode Activation**: Should headless mode be activated via:
   - Constructor parameter (`new OpenFields2(true)`)
   - System property (`-Dheadless=true`)
   - Static factory method (`OpenFields2.createHeadless()`)
   - Or a combination of these approaches?
   - **Recommendation**: Constructor parameter (`new OpenFields2(true)`) - Simple, explicit, and easy to test

2. **Event Loop Implementation**: For the headless game loop, should we:
   - Create a completely separate tick processor
   - Modify GameClock to support both modes
   - Use a strategy pattern for different loop implementations
   - What's the preferred architectural approach?
   - **Recommendation**: Modify GameClock to support both modes - Maintains consistency and reduces code duplication

3. **Platform Abstraction**: The current Platform interface may need extensions for headless operation. Should we:
   - Extend the existing Platform interface
   - Create a separate HeadlessPlatform interface
   - Modify TestPlatform to handle all headless needs
   - What level of abstraction is appropriate?
   - **Recommendation**: Modify TestPlatform to handle all headless needs - It's already designed for testing

### Test Design Questions
4. **Random Number Control**: For deterministic testing, how should we handle randomness:
   - Inject a random number generator into game systems
   - Use a global random seed for entire test
   - Allow per-system random seeds
   - What's the preferred approach for test repeatability?
   - **Recommendation**: Use a global random seed for entire test - Simple and sufficient for current needs

5. **Test Validation Depth**: Beyond matching GunfightTestAutomated, should HeadlessGunfightTest also:
   - Validate every weapon state transition - no
   - Check tick-by-tick combat progression - no
   - Verify all combat modifiers are applied - no
   - What level of detail is desired? - don't worry about detail at this time

6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Should the test include:
   - Automated performance regression detection - no
   - Comparison metrics with UI version - no
   - Memory usage profiling - no
   - What performance aspects are most important? - do not worry about performance

### Implementation Strategy Questions
7. **Refactoring Scope**: How aggressive should we be in refactoring OpenFields2:
   - Minimal changes just to support headless
   - Moderate refactoring to improve testability
   - Comprehensive separation of UI and game logic
   - What's the acceptable scope for this cycle?
- Minimal changes just to support headless. UI and game logic should already be separated.

8. **Backwards Compatibility**: Are there any concerns about:
   - Changes affecting normal game operation
   - Save file format modifications - No
   - API changes for future development
   - What compatibility constraints exist?

We are not concerned wtih backwards compatibility

9. **Error Handling**: For headless mode failures, should we:
   - Fail fast with detailed error messages
   - Attempt graceful degradation
   - Provide diagnostic modes
   - What's the preferred error handling strategy?
- Fail fast with detailed error message

### Integration Questions

    - Run on every commit
    - Part of a separate test suite
    - Integrated with existing test infrastructure
    - What's the deployment strategy?
- Part of a separate test suite

11. **Future Headless Tests**: Beyond HeadlessGunfightTest, are there plans for:
    - Headless melee combat tests
    - Headless movement tests
    - Headless full game simulations
    - What's the long-term vision?
- There are more headless tests, but don't worry about that right now

12. **Documentation Requirements**: What documentation is needed:
    - Developer guide for headless mode
    - Test writing guidelines
    - Architecture documentation
    - What documentation is priority?
- No documentation is necessary 

### Additional Technical Questions

13. **Input System Handling**: Since OpenFields2 uses InputManager for keyboard/mouse events:
    - Should we create a HeadlessInputManager that simulates input events?
    - Can we bypass InputManager entirely in headless mode?
    - How should combat targeting simulation work without actual mouse clicks?
    - Should we expose programmatic APIs for actions normally triggered by input?
    - **Recommendation**: Expose programmatic APIs for actions - Clean separation and testable

14. **Graphics Context Dependencies**: TestPlatform provides a graphics context, but:
    - Are there any OpenFields2 operations that require actual rendering to function?
    - How should we handle canvas size/viewport calculations in headless mode?
    - Do any game mechanics depend on visual feedback loops?
    - Should TestPlatform maintain a virtual framebuffer?
    - **Recommendation**: Use fixed canvas size (800x600) and no virtual framebuffer - Simple and sufficient

15. **Thread Management**: JavaFX has specific threading requirements:
    - How should we handle operations that expect to run on JavaFX Application Thread?
    - Should headless mode use single-threaded execution for simplicity?
    - Are there any concurrent operations that need special handling?
    - How do we ensure thread safety without Platform.runLater()?
    - **Recommendation**: Single-threaded execution for headless mode - Deterministic and simple

16. **Resource Loading**: The game loads various resources (sounds, images):
    - Should headless mode skip resource loading entirely?
    - Create stub resources for testing?
    - Load resources but not use them?
    - What's the impact on test coverage if resources aren't loaded?
    - **Recommendation**: Create stub resources for testing - Ensures code paths are tested

### Test-Specific Questions

17. **Test Data Management**: For consistent test execution:
    - Should we create a dedicated test save file instead of using test_b.json?
    - How do we ensure test isolation if multiple tests modify game state?
    - Should each test method create its own game instance?
    - What's the cleanup strategy between test runs?
    - **Recommendation**: Use test_b.json, create new game instance per test, reset in @BeforeEach

18. **Combat Simulation Fidelity**: To truly mirror GunfightTestAutomated:
    - Do we need to simulate the exact timing of user actions (delays between clicks)? - no
    - Should we replicate the rectangle selection behavior programmatically? - yes
    - How closely should we match the UI test's setup sequence?
    - Are there UI-specific behaviors we should intentionally skip?
    - **Recommendation**: Match setup sequence exactly, skip only visual feedback (animations, highlights)

19. **Assertion Strategy**: For comprehensive validation:
    - Should we capture and compare entire combat logs between UI and headless?
    - Create a "golden master" of expected combat outcomes?
    - Allow for acceptable variance in results due to timing differences?
    - How do we handle non-deterministic elements like critical hits?
    - **Recommendation**: Compare key outcomes (winner, health, shots fired) with fixed seed for determinism

### Architecture Questions

20. **Dependency Injection**: To support both modes cleanly:
    - Should we introduce dependency injection for platform-specific services?
    - Would a service locator pattern be more appropriate?
    - How do we minimize code duplication between modes?
    - Should game systems be made more modular to support this?
    - **Recommendation**: Keep it simple - use existing Platform interface pattern, no new DI framework

21. **State Management**: For test reliability:
    - Should we add game state serialization/deserialization for test snapshots?
    - How do we ensure complete state reset between test runs?
    - Should headless mode expose additional state inspection APIs?
    - What level of state introspection is needed for debugging?
    - **Recommendation**: Create new game instance per test, expose getters for key state (units, characters)

22. **Performance Monitoring**: Given the 10x performance target:
    - Should we add built-in profiling to track performance regression? - No
    - What metrics should be collected during headless execution? - None
    - How do we ensure performance improvements don't compromise accuracy? - Prioritize accuracy 
    - Should there be a "fast" mode that trades accuracy for speed? - No
