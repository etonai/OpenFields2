# InputManager Readability Optimization - DevCycle 2025_0015k
*Created: June 22, 2025 | Last Design Update: June 22, 2025 | Last Implementation Update: [Pending] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
DevCycle 15k addresses the critical practical issue discovered after 15j: InputManager.java exceeds readable file limits for both AI tools and human developers. At 2,479 lines generating ~30,715 tokens, the file cannot be read in a single operation, severely impacting development efficiency. This cycle will refactor InputManager to achieve practical readability while maintaining architectural quality.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- **Achieve readable file size** under 25,000 tokens (~1,800-2,000 lines based on current ratio)
- **Extract large method blocks** that contribute most to file size
- **Create functional separation** between different input handling domains
- **Preserve all functionality** through careful delegation and service integration
- **Improve code navigability** for both AI and human developers
- **Maintain performance** at 60 FPS with minimal delegation overhead

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15j complete (service architecture established)
- All existing services (WorkflowStateCoordinator, InputValidationService, etc.) functional
- Comprehensive understanding of remaining InputManager structure
- Clear extraction targets identified through code analysis

**Estimated Complexity:** High - Requires careful analysis and extraction of core functionality without breaking system integration

## Preliminary Analysis

### Token Reduction Requirements
- **Current State**: 2,479 lines ≈ 30,715 tokens
- **Target State**: <25,000 tokens ≈ 1,800-2,000 lines
- **Required Reduction**: ~5,715 tokens ≈ 460-680 lines minimum
- **Optimal Target**: 1,500-1,800 lines for comfortable margin

### High-Impact Extraction Targets
Based on typical InputManager patterns, the largest token consumers are likely:
1. **Event Handler Methods**: handleKeyPressed, handleKeyReleased (~300-500 lines)
2. **Mouse Handling Logic**: handleMousePressed, handleMouseReleased, handleMouseMoved (~400-600 lines)
3. **Number Input Processing**: handleNumberInput with all workflow branches (~200-300 lines)
4. **Character Creation Methods**: Multiple methods handling creation workflow (~200-400 lines)
5. **Edit Mode Operations**: Character deployment, weapon assignment (~300-400 lines)

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

### Service Integration Architecture
```
InputManager (1,500-1,800 lines)
├── MouseInputHandler → Handle all mouse events
├── KeyboardInputHandler → Handle all keyboard events
├── NumberInputProcessor → Handle numeric workflows
└── EditModeInputHandler → Handle edit mode operations

Shared Services:
├── SelectionManager → Unit selection state
├── WorkflowStateCoordinator → Workflow state management
├── InputValidationService → Input validation
├── InputDiagnosticService → Diagnostics/debugging
└── InputPatternUtilities → Common patterns
```

### Integration Priorities
1. **State Consistency**: All handlers must share consistent game state view
2. **Event Ordering**: Preserve original event processing order
3. **Performance**: Minimal overhead from delegation (<1ms per event)
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive event tracking across all handlers

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**New Files to Create:**
- **`MouseInputHandler.java`** - All mouse event processing (~400-600 lines)
- **`KeyboardInputHandler.java`** - All keyboard event processing (~400-600 lines)
- **`NumberInputProcessor.java`** - Numeric input workflows (~300-400 lines)
- **`EditModeInputHandler.java`** - Enhanced edit mode operations (~300-500 lines)

**Modified Files:**
- **`InputManager.java`** - Reduced to coordination and delegation (~1,500-1,800 lines)
- **`EditModeManager.java`** - Enhanced with input handling capabilities

### Delegation Strategy
```java
// Example: InputManager after extraction
public class InputManager {
    private final MouseInputHandler mouseHandler;
    private final KeyboardInputHandler keyboardHandler;
    private final NumberInputProcessor numberProcessor;
    private final EditModeInputHandler editModeHandler;
    
    public void handleMousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        // Simple delegation - 3-5 lines instead of 150-200
        MouseContext context = createMouseContext(e);
        mouseHandler.handlePressed(context);
        updateDiagnostics("Mouse pressed", context);
    }
    
    public void handleKeyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        // Simple delegation - 3-5 lines instead of 200-300
        KeyContext context = createKeyContext(e);
        keyboardHandler.handlePressed(context);
        updateDiagnostics("Key pressed", context);
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Context Objects**: Lightweight DTOs for event data
- **Direct References**: Handlers maintain direct service references
