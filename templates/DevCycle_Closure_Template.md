# DevCycle Closure Template

**Use this template for EVERY DevCycle closure to ensure no steps are missed.**

## DevCycle Information
- **DevCycle Number**: DC_##
- **Development Branch**: DC_##
- **Closure Date**: [Date]
- **Systems Completed**: [Count] of [Total]

## Pre-Closure Validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] All implementation tasks completed
- [ ] Code compiles successfully (`mvn compile`)
- [ ] All tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] All critical bugs resolved

## MANDATORY Closure Steps ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Final Documentation
- [ ] Update DevCycle document status to "CLOSED"
- [ ] Add comprehensive close-out summary
- [ ] Document final metrics and achievements
- [ ] Add recommendations for future work

### Step 2: Final Commit
- [ ] Stage documentation changes (`git add`)
- [ ] Create final commit with closure message
- [ ] Verify commit successful (`git status`)

### Step 3: Branch Merge (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
- [ ] Switch to main branch (`git checkout main`)
- [ ] Merge development branch (`git merge DC_##`)
- [ ] Verify merge successful (no conflicts)
- [ ] Check git log shows merge commit

### Step 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Delete development branch (`git branch -d DC_##`)
- [ ] Verify branch deleted (`git branch`)
- [ ] Final status check (`git status`)

### Step 5: Validation
- [ ] Confirm on main branch
- [ ] Verify all changes present
- [ ] Test compilation on main branch
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if needed

## üö® CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS üö®

**Before declaring DevCycle closed, verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Development branch has been merged to main
2. ‚úÖ Development branch has been deleted
3. ‚úÖ Currently on main branch with clean status
4. ‚úÖ All DevCycle work is present in main branch

**DevCycle is NOT closed until ALL git operations are complete.**

## Closure Declaration

**Status**: [ ] CLOSED ‚úÖ / [ ] INCOMPLETE ‚ùå

**Final Verification**:
- Main branch contains all DevCycle work: [ ] YES / [ ] NO
- Development branch deleted: [ ] YES / [ ] NO
- Documentation updated: [ ] YES / [ ] NO

**Claude Signature**: _DevCycle closure completed according to mandatory checklist_

**Template Usage**: Copy this template to the end of each DevCycle document before closure begins. Check off each item as completed. Do not declare closure until ALL items are checked.
