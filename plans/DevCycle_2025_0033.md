*Created: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-30 at 11:15 | Last Implementation Update: [TBD] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle focuses on iteratively enhancing the melee combat system by implementing one system at a time. Each system will be planned, implemented, tested, and validated before adding the next system to the cycle. This approach ensures thorough testing and integration of each component while maintaining system stability.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Iteratively improve melee combat systems with focused, incremental changes
- Plan, implement, and test each system thoroughly before adding the next
- Maintain existing functionality while enhancing melee combat capabilities
- Build a foundation for advanced melee combat features in future cycles

**Prerequisites:** 
- Understanding of current melee combat system architecture
- Access to output.txt analysis showing the spam pattern
- Familiarity with Character, CombatCoordinator, and MeleeCombatSequenceManager classes

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Requires careful tracking of recovery state and moving audio triggers without breaking existing logic

### 2. Fix Excessive Attack Continuation Triggering ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Root Cause Investigation**
  - [ ] Investigate why handleAttackContinuation() is called every tick during recovery
  - [ ] Identify the system triggering continuous attack continuation calls
  - [ ] Analyze auto-targeting system behavior during recovery periods
  - [ ] Check event scheduling patterns for attack continuation
  - [ ] Review persistent attack logic for over-triggering

- [ ] **Attack Continuation Flow Fix**
  - [ ] Fix the source system causing every-tick attack continuation calls
  - [ ] Implement proper timing for attack continuation (only when appropriate)
  - [ ] Ensure attack continuation waits for recovery to end naturally
  - [ ] Remove or reduce the frequency of recovery blocking in handleAttackContinuation()
  - [ ] Validate that attack continuation resumes correctly after recovery

- [ ] **System Integration Validation**
  - [ ] Test auto-targeting behavior with corrected attack continuation timing
  - [ ] Verify persistent attack mode works correctly with proper timing
  - [ ] Ensure melee combat flow feels natural without excessive blocking
  - [ ] Confirm no regression in legitimate attack continuation scenarios

**System 2 Design Specifications:**
- **Investigation Focus**: Identify the system calling handleAttackContinuation() every tick during recovery
- **Fix Approach**: Address root cause rather than just blocking symptoms
- **Timing Goal**: Attack continuation should only trigger when recovery naturally ends or when re-targeting is needed
- **Integration Points**: Works with auto-targeting, persistent attack, and recovery systems
- **Performance Goal**: Eliminate unnecessary every-tick attack continuation calls
- **Debug Support**: Add debug logging to trace attack continuation call sources

**System 1 Design Specifications:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: Track recovery end tick per character to prevent overlapping attack scheduling (melee-specific only)
- **Audio Timing**: Audio plays only when attack executes successfully, not when scheduled (no additional throttling)
- **Integration Points**: Works with existing auto-targeting, persistent attack, and weapon state systems
- **User Interface**: No UI changes required - fix is purely backend logic
- **Performance Requirements**: Eliminate 60 audio events per second spam, reducing CPU/audio load
- **Recovery Persistence**: Recovery continues until natural end time regardless of weapon/mode changes
- **Debug Integration**: Recovery state transitions logged using existing combat debug flag
- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - Incapacitated characters: Cancel recovery (no further actions possible)
  - Incapacitated targets: Recovery continues regardless of target state
  - Mode switches: Recovery must complete before weapon switch completes
- **Save System**: Recovery state is transient and not saved

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: 
  - `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Add recovery state tracking with duration storage for debugging
  - `src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java` - Fix handleAttackContinuation method, add edge case handling
  - `src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java` - Move audio trigger, add debug messages
- **New Classes/Enums**: None required
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes needed (recovery state not persisted)
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Fully backwards compatible, purely bug fix
- **Thread Safety**: Simple field access (single-threaded tick system)
- **Testing Approach**: Manual testing focused on audio elimination

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`src/main/java/combat/Character.java`** - Add meleeRecoveryEndTick field and isInMeleeRecovery() method
- **`src/main/java/combat/CombatCoordinator.java`** - Add recovery check in handleAttackContinuation() before auto-targeting
- **`src/main/java/combat/managers/MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java`** - Move audio from scheduleMeleeAttack() to event execution

**New Components Required:**
- **Recovery Tracking**: meleeRecoveryEndTick (long) and recovery duration (long) fields in Character class
- **Recovery Validation**: isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick) method in Character class
- **Debug Integration**: Combat debug messages for recovery state transitions

### Data Flow
**Information flow for attack prevention:**
1. **Auto-targeting Trigger** → **Recovery State Check** → **Block or Allow Attack Scheduling**
2. **Melee Attack Schedule** → **Event Execution** → **Recovery Validation** → **Audio Playback**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - single long field per character

## Planning Questions for System 2 Review

### Root Cause Analysis Questions

1. **Auto-targeting Call Source**: Based on my investigation, I found that `updateAutomaticTargeting` is called every tick from the main game loop (OpenFields2.java line 153). For characters with auto-targeting enabled and a valid current target, lines 106-149 in AutoTargetingSystem.java may initiate attacks. Should we add a check to prevent re-initiating attacks when `isAttacking` is already true, or is there a deeper issue?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, we should add a check to prevent re-initiating attacks during recovery. The current `isAttacking` check at line 40 in AutoTargetingSystem.java is insufficient because `isAttacking` is cleared when recovery starts (line 180 in MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java), allowing auto-targeting to immediately try starting new attacks during recovery.

2. **Recovery State Persistence**: When a melee attack completes and enters recovery, the `isAttacking` flag is cleared (MeleeCombatSequenceManager.java line 180). This allows auto-targeting to immediately try to start a new attack on the next tick. Should `isAttacking` remain true during the recovery period to prevent this?
   
   **Answer**: Rather than changing the semantics of `isAttacking`, we should add a specific recovery check to auto-targeting. The `isInMeleeRecovery()` method already exists and should be used in the auto-targeting system to prevent attacks during recovery.

3. **Attack Continuation vs Auto-targeting**: There appear to be two systems that can trigger attacks:
   - `checkContinuousAttack` called after recovery ends (line 187 in MeleeCombatSequenceManager)
   - `updateAutomaticTargeting` called every tick from the game loop
   
   Are both systems necessary, or should auto-targeting be disabled during active combat sequences?
   
   **Answer**: Both systems serve different purposes. Auto-targeting should handle initial target acquisition for idle characters, while `checkContinuousAttack` should handle attack continuation after recovery. Auto-targeting should be disabled during active combat sequences (attacking, recovering, moving to melee).

### Design Questions

4. **Recovery State Management**: Should we introduce a new state like `isRecovering` that's separate from `isAttacking`, or should we extend the meaning of `isAttacking` to include the recovery period?
   
   **Answer**: Use the existing `isInMeleeRecovery()` method rather than creating new state variables. This maintains consistency with the existing recovery tracking system implemented in System 1.

5. **Attack Continuation Timing**: Currently, `checkContinuousAttack` is scheduled to run when recovery ends. Should this be the only way to continue attacks for characters in persistent attack mode, rather than having auto-targeting also trigger attacks?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, `checkContinuousAttack` should be the only way to continue attacks for characters already in combat. Auto-targeting should only initiate attacks for idle characters who don't have a current target or combat sequence in progress.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Would it be better to have auto-targeting check less frequently (e.g., every 10 ticks) rather than every single tick, especially when a character is already engaged in combat?
   
   **Answer**: Keep the current frequency but add early exit conditions. Checking every tick is acceptable for idle characters needing target acquisition, but characters in combat should exit early from auto-targeting checks.

### Implementation Questions

7. **Attack State Machine**: Should we implement a more formal state machine for attack sequences that includes states like IDLE, ATTACKING, RECOVERING, READY_TO_ATTACK to better control when new attacks can be initiated?
   
   **Answer**: No, avoid over-engineering. Use the existing boolean checks (`isAttacking`, `isInMeleeRecovery()`, `isMovingToMelee`) but ensure they cover the complete attack lifecycle. A formal state machine would add complexity without clear benefit.

8. **Auto-targeting Scope**: Should auto-targeting only be responsible for initial target acquisition and leave attack continuation to the existing persistent attack system?
   
   **Answer**: Yes, auto-targeting should only handle initial target acquisition for idle characters. Once a character enters any phase of combat (attacking, recovering, moving to melee), other systems should handle the progression.

### Technical Questions

9. **Event Scheduling**: When auto-targeting tries to start an attack while in recovery, does it create duplicate scheduled events, or does the recovery check in `handleAttackContinuation` prevent this?
   
   **Answer**: It creates unnecessary calls to `handleAttackContinuation` which then get blocked by the recovery check. This is inefficient and creates the "spam" we're trying to eliminate. Prevention at the auto-targeting level is more efficient.

10. **Melee vs Ranged**: Does the same issue occur with ranged weapons, or is this specific to melee combat due to how recovery is handled differently?
    
    **Answer**: This needs investigation. Ranged weapons may have different recovery handling. The fix should check if the character is in any combat-related state that should prevent new attack initiation, regardless of weapon type.

## Recommendations for System 2

Based on my analysis, here are my recommendations for each question:

1. **Add Early Exit Check**: Add `if (character.isAttacking || character.isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick)) return;` at the beginning of the auto-targeting check (line 115 in AutoTargetingSystem.java).

2. **Keep isAttacking True**: Modify the recovery scheduling to not clear `isAttacking` until recovery actually completes, not when it starts.

3. **Separate Responsibilities**: Auto-targeting should only handle initial target acquisition. Once combat starts, let the persistent attack system handle continuation.

4. **Use Existing Recovery Check**: The `isInMeleeRecovery()` method already exists. Use it in auto-targeting rather than creating new state variables.

5. **Single Continuation Path**: Only use `checkContinuousAttack` for attack continuation. Auto-targeting should skip characters who are in any phase of an attack sequence.

6. **Conditional Frequency**: Check auto-targeting every tick only for idle characters. Skip characters who are attacking, recovering, or reloading.

7. **Lightweight State Check**: Instead of a full state machine, use the existing boolean checks but ensure they cover the complete attack lifecycle.

8. **Limited Auto-targeting Role**: Yes, auto-targeting should only acquire targets for idle characters and let other systems handle active combat.

9. **Add Debug Logging**: Add logging to track when auto-targeting attempts to start attacks during recovery to verify the fix.

10. **Check Both Systems**: Verify if ranged weapons have the same issue. If not, align melee recovery handling with ranged weapon recovery.

**Primary Recommendation**: The simplest fix is to modify line 115 in AutoTargetingSystem.java to check for melee recovery:
```java
if (character.isMovingToMelee || character.isAttacking || 
    (character.isMeleeCombatMode && character.isInMeleeRecovery(currentTick))) {
    return;
}
```

This prevents auto-targeting from attempting to start new attacks during the recovery period, eliminating the root cause of the excessive `handleAttackContinuation` calls.
