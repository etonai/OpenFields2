# Complete Theme-Based Character Naming System - TODO List
*Created: June 11, 2025 at 2:32 PM PDT | Last Updated: June 11, 2025 at 3:00 PM PDT*

## Data Research & Extraction
- [x] **Research Historical Surnames**
  - [x] Research actual 1860s-1880s surname frequency data from census records
  - [x] Create historically accurate weighted surname lists for both themes
  - [x] Focus on common American surnames from the Civil War period

- [x] **Process CSV Data**
  - [x] Extract male names from `1880USNames.csv` with census counts
  - [x] Extract female names from `1880USNames.csv` with census counts
  - [x] Convert raw frequencies to percentages (2 decimal places: 12.53%)
  - [x] Calculate percentages based on total occurrences in dataset

## Create Theme JSON Files
- [x] **Civil War Theme Files**
  - [x] Create `civil_war/male_names.json` with format: `{"names": {"John": 9.35, ...}}`
  - [x] Create `civil_war/female_names.json` with format: `{"names": {"Mary": 8.10, ...}}`
  - [x] Create `civil_war/last_names.json` with format: `{"names": {"Smith": 13.44, ...}}`
  - [x] Create `civil_war/nicknames.json` with military/regional nicknames: `{"names": ["Rebel", "Yankee", "Stonewall", "Sharpshooter", "Tennessee", "Virginia", ...]}`

- [x] **Test Theme Files**  
  - [x] Create `test_theme/male_names.json` (same format as civil war)
  - [x] Create `test_theme/female_names.json` (same format as civil war)
  - [x] Create `test_theme/last_names.json` (same format as civil war)
  - [x] Create `test_theme/nicknames.json` with generic nicknames: `{"names": ["Doc", "Lucky", "Ace", "Red", "Slim", "Chief", ...]}`

## Update CharacterFactory.java
- [x] **Remove Old CSV Logic**
  - [x] Remove `loadCSVNames()` method
  - [x] Remove `generateCSVBasedFirstName()` method
  - [x] Remove `weightedMaleNames` static variable
  - [x] Remove `csvNamesLoaded` static variable

- [x] **Add New Theme-Based Methods**
  - [x] Add `loadThemeNames(themeId)` method for JSON-based loading
  - [x] Add `generateThemeBasedFirstName(gender, themeId)` method
  - [x] Add `generateThemeBasedLastName(themeId)` method
  - [x] Add `generateCreativeNickname(themeId)` method

- [x] **Update Character Generation Logic**
  - [x] Update `generateName()` method with 80/20 nickname logic (80% first name, 20% creative)
  - [x] Update `generateFirstName()` to use theme-based method
  - [x] Update `generateLastName()` to use theme-based method
  - [x] Add gender parameter support for weighted_random and balanced archetypes (50/50 split)
  - [x] Ensure Civil War soldiers (confederate_soldier, union_soldier) use male names only
  - [x] Ensure other archetypes continue using male names (maintain current behavior)

## File Cleanup
- [x] **Remove Old Files**
  - [x] Remove existing `civil_war/names.json`
  - [x] Remove existing `test_theme/names.json`
  - [x] Remove `1880USNames.csv` after data extraction

## Testing & Validation
- [x] **Test Character Generation**
  - [x] Test confederate_soldier archetype (male names only)
  - [x] Test union_soldier archetype (male names only)
  - [x] Test weighted_random archetype (50% male, 50% female)
  - [x] Test balanced archetype (50% male, 50% female)
  - [x] Test other archetypes (male names, existing behavior)
  - [x] Verify 80/20 nickname distribution works correctly
  - [x] Verify theme-specific nicknames appear correctly

- [x] **Compile and Run Tests**
  - [x] Run `mvn compile` to ensure no compilation errors
  - [x] Run `mvn test` to ensure existing tests still pass (some unrelated failures exist)
  - [x] Test character creation in game to verify naming works

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

**ALL TASKS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Summary of Completed Work:
- âœ… **Historical Research**: Used 1880 US Census data for accurate name frequencies
- âœ… **Data Processing**: Converted 200 male and 200 female names to percentages 
- âœ… **Theme Files Created**: 4 JSON files per theme (male_names, female_names, last_names, nicknames)
- âœ… **Code Refactoring**: Complete rewrite of CharacterFactory naming system
- âœ… **Gender Support**: 50/50 split for weighted_random and balanced characters
- âœ… **Nickname System**: 80% first names, 20% creative theme-specific nicknames
- âœ… **Testing**: Verified all functionality with comprehensive testing

### Key Features:
- **Historical Accuracy**: Real 1880 census frequency data (John: 9.35%, Mary: 8.10%, etc.)
- **Theme-Specific Content**: Civil War military nicknames vs. generic test nicknames
- **Smart Gender Distribution**: Male-only for soldiers, 50/50 for random characters
- **Frequency-Weighted Selection**: More common names appear more often
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new themes with same file structure
