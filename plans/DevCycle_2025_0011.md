*Created: June 18, 2025 1:49 PM PDT | Last Design Update: June 18, 2025 2:28 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: NONE | Implementation Status: PLANNING*

## Overview
DevCycle 11 addresses two critical technical debt issues in the combat system that are actively causing gameplay and maintenance problems. This cycle focuses on consolidating duplicate stat modifier methods and implementing a comprehensive health/damage scaling system to fix melee combat balance while improving consistency with the character stat system.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Consolidate duplicate stat modifier methods across the codebase
- Scale health system from 20 base to 100 base for consistency with other character stats
- Implement balanced strength damage bonuses for melee combat
- Ensure all weapon damage scales proportionally with the new health system

**Prerequisites:** 
- Completed DevCycle 10 with melee combat bug fixes
- Functional melee and ranged combat systems

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium-High - Health scaling affects many systems and requires careful balance testing

## System Implementations

### 1. Stat Modifier Consolidation ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Code Audit and Analysis**
  - [ ] Identify all duplicate `getStatModifier`/`statToModifier` implementations across codebase
  - [ ] Analyze differences between implementations to ensure compatibility
  - [ ] Document all current usage locations and their specific requirements
  - [ ] Plan migration strategy for each usage location

- [ ] **Centralized Implementation**
  - [ ] Standardize on `GameConstants.statToModifier()` as the single implementation
  - [ ] Remove duplicate method definitions from `CombatResolver.java`
  - [ ] Remove duplicate implementations from `Character.java`, `CombatCalculator.java`
  - [ ] Update all calling code to use centralized method
  - [ ] Comprehensive testing of all stat-dependent calculations

**Design Specifications:**
- **Centralization Target**: All stat modifier calculations use `GameConstants.statToModifier()`
- **Consistency Requirement**: Identical modifier values for same stat inputs across all systems
- **Integration Points**: Combat calculations, character stats, weapon readying, skill bonuses
- **Performance Requirements**: No performance degradation from centralization
- **Error Handling**: Maintain existing stat clamping and validation behavior

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `CombatResolver.java`, `Character.java`, `CombatCalculator.java`, `InputManager.java`, `OpenFields2.java`
- **New Classes/Enums**: None required
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes required
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Full compatibility with existing stat calculations

### 2. Health System Scaling and Damage Balance ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Health System Scaling**
  - [ ] Update base character health from 20 to 100 in character creation
  - [ ] Locate original 6 characters' health values (likely in character.json file) and scale to 100 base (full health)
  - [ ] Update health-related constants in `GameConstants.java`
  - [ ] Delete any saved characters except for the 6 original characters
  - [ ] Test character creation and health assignment with new scale

- [ ] **Weapon Damage Scaling**
  - [ ] Create script to automatically scale weapon damage values by 5x in JSON files
  - [ ] Scale all ranged weapon damage values by 5x in test_theme and civil_war JSON files
  - [ ] Scale all melee weapon damage values by 5x in test_theme and civil_war JSON files
  - [ ] Skip test code damage value scaling (not needed for this cycle)
  - [ ] Verify proportional scaling maintains relative weapon balance
  - [ ] Test all weapon types with scaled damage values
  - [ ] Validate damage output against new health pools

- [ ] **Strength Damage Bonus System**
  - [ ] Implement `getStrengthDamageBonus()` method in `GameConstants` with -10 to +15 range
  - [ ] Apply strength bonus after wound severity modifiers in melee damage calculation
  - [ ] Replace stat modifier usage in melee damage calculation
  - [ ] Test damage balance with various character strength levels
  - [ ] Ensure strength bonuses feel meaningful but not overwhelming
  - [ ] Validate melee vs ranged combat balance

**Design Specifications:**
- **Health Base Scale**: 100 base health (consistent with other character stats)
- **Damage Scaling Factor**: 5x increase for all weapon damage values
- **Strength Bonus Range**: -10 to +15 damage modifier based on strength stat (applied after wound severity)
- **Wound Damage Scaling**: All wound damage values scaled by 5x except scratches (remain at 1 damage)
- **Integration Points**: Combat resolution, character creation, 6 original characters in `createUnits()`
- **Performance Requirements**: No impact on combat calculation performance
- **Error Handling**: No save file compatibility needed - focus on original 6 characters

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `CombatResolver.java`, `Character.java`, `GameConstants.java`, `OpenFields2.java` (createUnits), weapon JSON files in test_theme and civil_war themes
- **New Classes/Enums**: None required
- **Script Creation**: Automated JSON weapon damage scaling script
- **Wound System Changes**: Wound damage calculated from weapon base damage and severity - hardcoded scratch damage (1) unchanged
- **Character Health Location**: Original 6 characters' health values likely stored in character.json file
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Not needed - focus on original 6 characters only

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Stat Modifier + Health Scaling**: Consolidated stat modifiers must work correctly with new health scale
- **Weapon Damage + Strength Bonuses**: Scaled weapon damage and strength bonuses must maintain combat balance
- **Wound System + Damage Scaling**: Wound damage scaling (except scratches) must integrate properly with combat resolution

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Stat Modifier Consolidation**: Must be completed first to ensure consistent calculations (highest priority)
2. **Health System Scaling**: Foundation for balanced damage system (high priority)
3. **Strength Damage System**: Builds upon consolidated modifiers and scaled health (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`GameConstants.java`** - Central stat modifier method, health constants, `getStrengthDamageBonus()` method
- **`CombatResolver.java`** - Remove duplicate stat modifier, update melee damage calculation with strength bonus after wound severity
- **`Character.java`** - Remove duplicate implementations, update health values and creation
- **`CombatCalculator.java`** - Update to use centralized stat modifier method
- **`InputManager.java`** - Update stat modifier usage for character displays
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Update direct stat modifier usage, locate and update 6 original characters' health to 100 base
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/ranged-weapons.json`** - Scale damage values by 5x via script
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/melee-weapons.json`** - Scale damage values by 5x via script
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/civil_war/ranged-weapons.json`** - Scale damage values by 5x via script
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/civil_war/melee-weapons.json`** - Scale damage values by 5x via script
- **Wound system files** - Update wound damage calculation to work with scaled weapon damage (scratch damage remains hardcoded at 1)

**New Components Required:**
- **`getStrengthDamageBonus()` method**: Specialized strength modifier for damage calculations in `GameConstants`
- **JSON scaling script**: Automated tool to scale weapon damage values by 5x
- **Wound damage calculation updates**: Ensure wound damage calculation works properly with scaled weapon damage (scratch damage unchanged at 1)

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Stat Input** → **GameConstants.statToModifier()** → **Consistent Modifier Output**
2. **Character Creation** → **100 Base Health Assignment** → **Consistent Health Scale**
3. **Original Characters** → **Full Health Assignment** → **100 Base Health Scale**
4. **Melee Attack** → **Wound Severity Calculation** → **Strength Damage Bonus** → **Balanced Damage Output**
5. **JSON Weapon Files** → **Automated Scaling Script** → **5x Damage Values**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - no significant data structure changes
- **CPU Usage**: No increase - same calculation complexity with centralized methods
- **Rendering Impact**: No impact on graphics performance
- **Script Performance**: JSON scaling script runs once during implementation
