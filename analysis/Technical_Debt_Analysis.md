# Technical Debt Analysis - OpenFields2
*Generated: 2025-06-24*

## Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of technical debt in the OpenFields2 codebase, prioritized by impact and effort required for resolution.

## High Priority Debt

### 1. JavaFX Coupling in Core Entities
**Impact**: 🔴 Critical | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: Medium

**Description**: The Unit and Character classes are tightly coupled to JavaFX, preventing full platform independence.

**Specific Issues**:
- Unit class uses `javafx.scene.paint.Color` directly
- Character references JavaFX through Unit dependencies
- Movement and rendering logic mixed with entity state

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Create IUnit and ICharacter interfaces with platform-agnostic types
2. Move JavaFX-specific code to platform.impl.javafx adapters
3. Use platform-independent color representation (RGB integers)
4. Separate rendering concerns from entity logic

**Business Impact**: Blocks console mode, automated testing, and future platform ports

### 2. Character Class Responsibilities
**Impact**: 🟠 High | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: The Character class (2300+ lines) handles too many responsibilities, violating Single Responsibility Principle.

**Current Responsibilities**:
- Attribute management
- Combat state tracking
- Weapon management
- Skill calculations
- Movement logic
- Attack scheduling
- Event handling
- Statistics tracking
- AI targeting
- Wound management

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Extract CombatState class for combat-specific state
2. Create WeaponManager for weapon switching/state
3. Move attack scheduling to CombatOrchestrator
4. Extract TargetingSystem for AI logic
5. Create CharacterStats for statistics tracking

**Business Impact**: Difficult to maintain, test, and extend; source of bugs

### 3. Limited Test Coverage
**Impact**: 🟠 High | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Only 13% file coverage with 14 test files for 105 source files.

**Critical Untested Areas**:
- CombatCalculator hit determination logic
- Event scheduling system
- Weapon state transitions
- Movement calculations
- Save/load functionality

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Prioritize unit tests for CombatCalculator
2. Create integration tests using console backend
3. Add property-based tests for combat scenarios
4. Implement save/load round-trip tests
5. Target 50% coverage for core systems

**Business Impact**: Regression risk, confidence in changes, refactoring difficulty

## Medium Priority Debt

### 4. Event Queue Persistence
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium

**Description**: Scheduled events are not saved, causing loss of in-progress actions.

**Affected Systems**:
- Combat animations and effects
- Projectiles in flight
- Scheduled attacks
- Hesitation/bravery timers

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Make ScheduledEvent serializable
2. Create EventSerializer with action type registry
3. Implement event restoration on load
4. Add version migration support

**Business Impact**: Poor save/load experience, player frustration

### 5. Hard-coded Game Constants
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Game balance values scattered throughout code instead of configuration.

**Examples**:
- Movement speeds in Unit class
- Combat modifiers in CombatCalculator
- Skill bonuses hardcoded in methods
- Tick rates and timing values

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Create GameBalance configuration class
2. Move all constants to JSON configuration
3. Implement hot-reload for development
4. Add validation for balance changes

**Business Impact**: Difficult balancing, requires recompilation for tweaks

### 6. Platform Abstraction Incompleteness
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Platform abstraction exists but isn't fully utilized.

**Gaps**:
- Sound system partially abstracted
- Input handling still JavaFX-centric
- No platform-independent UI elements
- Resource loading assumes classpath

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Complete AudioSystem abstraction
2. Create platform-independent input events
3. Design UI element abstraction
4. Implement resource provider pattern

**Business Impact**: Limits platform portability, testing capabilities

## Low Priority Debt

### 7. Magic Numbers and Strings
**Impact**: 🟢 Low | **Effort**: Low | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Numeric constants and strings used directly in code.

**Examples**:
- Pixel-to-feet conversion (7.0)
- Weapon state names as strings
- Default values scattered in constructors
- File paths hardcoded

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Create named constants
2. Use enums for state names
3. Centralize default values
4. Implement path configuration

### 8. Incomplete Error Handling
**Impact**: 🟢 Low | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Inconsistent error handling and recovery strategies.

**Issues**:
- Silent failures in some systems
- Inconsistent logging
- No unified error recovery
- Missing null checks in places

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Implement consistent error handling policy
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Create error recovery strategies
4. Add defensive programming practices

### 9. Performance Optimizations
**Impact**: 🟢 Low | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: Medium

**Description**: Current design may not scale to 40+ characters efficiently.

**Potential Issues**:
- O(n²) distance calculations
- Frequent list iterations
- No spatial indexing
- Render everything approach

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Implement spatial hashing for units
2. Add view frustum culling
3. Cache frequently calculated values
4. Profile and optimize hot paths

### 10. Documentation Gaps
**Impact**: 🟢 Low | **Effort**: Low | **Risk**: Low

**Description**: Some systems lack comprehensive documentation.

**Missing Documentation**:
- Platform abstraction usage
- Event system architecture
- Combat calculation details
- AI targeting logic

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Add package-level documentation
2. Document complex algorithms
3. Create architecture diagrams
4. Add usage examples

## Conclusion

The OpenFields2 codebase shows signs of healthy evolution with some accumulated technical debt. The highest priority items (JavaFX coupling and test coverage) directly impact the project's stated goals of platform independence and campaign gameplay. Addressing these items will unlock significant development velocity and reduce long-term maintenance costs.

The debt is manageable and well-understood, with clear resolution paths. The recommended phased approach balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability.
