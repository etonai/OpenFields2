# DevCycle 15b Testing Results
*Testing Session: June 21, 2025*

## Overview
Comprehensive testing and validation of InputManager functionality following DevCycle 15a conservative improvements. This document records detailed test results for all critical functionality areas.

## Test Environment
- **Application Build**: Successfully compiled with `mvn compile`
- **Test Run**: Application launched via `mvn javafx:run`
- **Initial State**: Game started paused, all systems operational
- **System Validation**: ‚úÖ All subsystems (faction registry, character persistence, theme manager, weapon factory) operational

## Phase 1: Critical Functionality Testing Results

### 1. Rectangle Selection Validation

#### Test 1.1: Multi-Unit Selection with Mouse Drag
**Test Procedure**: 
1. Start application (‚úÖ Completed)
2. Create multiple units for testing
3. Test mouse drag selection
4. Verify multiple units selected correctly

**Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
**Initial Findings**: 
- Application launches successfully
- System shows "Game is paused" - need to unpause for testing
- Need to create test characters first

**Next Steps**: 
- Unpause game (Space key)
- Create test characters for selection testing
- Perform mouse drag selection tests

#### Test 1.2: Selection Rectangle Rendering
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (depends on 1.1)

#### Test 1.3: Selection with Shift Modifier  
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (depends on 1.1)

#### Test 1.4: Selection State Management
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (depends on 1.1)

### 2. Melee Combat Testing
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (requires character setup)

### 3. Auto-Targeting Verification  
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (requires character setup)

### 4. Character Stats Display Testing
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** (requires character setup)

## Test Execution Notes

### Session 1: Application Launch and Initial Setup
**Time**: Initial session
**Findings**:
- ‚úÖ Application compiles and launches successfully
- ‚úÖ All system validations pass
- ‚úÖ Faction registry loaded (4 factions)
- ‚úÖ Weapon factory operational (10 weapons, 8 weapon types)
- ‚úÖ Theme manager operational (2 themes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Game starts in paused state - requires unpausing for testing

**Required Setup Steps**:
1. Unpause game (Space key)
2. Create test characters for functionality testing
3. Set up scenarios for each test category

## Testing Methodology

### Manual Testing Approach
Given the nature of InputManager functionality (mouse/keyboard interaction, visual feedback), manual testing is the most appropriate approach for this validation cycle.

### Test Documentation Standards
- **‚úÖ PASS**: Functionality works as expected
- **‚ùå FAIL**: Functionality broken or incorrect behavior
- **‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL**: Functionality works but with issues
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS**: Currently testing
- **‚è≥ PENDING**: Awaiting prerequisites

### Baseline Behavior Documentation
For each test, we will document:
1. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
2. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens  
3. **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Clear success metrics
4. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions tested
5. **Regression Notes**: Comparison to known good behavior

## Next Testing Steps

1. **Resume Game Session**: Unpause application for interactive testing
2. **Character Creation**: Create test characters for validation scenarios
3. **Rectangle Selection Testing**: Complete comprehensive selection validation
4. **Combat Testing**: Validate melee combat mechanics
5. **Auto-Targeting Testing**: Verify targeting system functionality
6. **Stats Display Testing**: Validate character information display

## Test Progress Summary

**Phase 1 Progress**: 1/16 tests initiated (6.25%)
- Rectangle Selection: 1/4 started
- Melee Combat: 0/4 started  
- Auto-Targeting: 0/4 started
- Character Stats: 0/4 started

**Overall DevCycle 15b Progress**: 1/51 total items initiated (2%)
