  - [x] Update character save serialization to include firing mode preference
  - [x] Implement firing mode preference application when characters equip weapons
  - [x] Test save/load cycle for firing mode preference preservation
  - [x] Validate firing mode preference behavior after load

**Design Specifications:**
- **Data Persistence**: Both character and weapon combat preferences must be saved
- **Save Format**: JSON with Jackson annotations for new fields
- **Testing Strategy**: Delete existing save files and create new scenarios for testing
- **User Interface**: No UI changes - backend save/load enhancement only
- **Performance Requirements**: No impact on save/load times

- **New Classes/Enums**: None - extending existing data structures
- **Database/Save Changes**: Save file format expanded with new fields
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Not required - will delete existing save files for clean testing

**SAVE SYSTEM DECISIONS:**
- **Firing Mode Storage**: Store `currentFiringMode` as character preference, not per-weapon instance
- **Weapon Save Strategy**: Weapons recreated from WeaponFactory, requiring character preference approach
- **Character vs Unit Data**: Store `usesAutomaticTargeting` in CharacterData for cross-scenario persistence
- **Save File Testing**: Basic save/load verification is sufficient for validation
- **Data Migration**: No null checks or default values needed for this implementation

### 3. Weapon Render State System ✅ **COMPLETED**

  - [x] Update Character.java methods that clear currentTarget to maintain lastTargetFacing
  - [x] Ensure weapons show aiming at last target instead of being hidden
  - [x] Test automatic targeting scenarios with weapon visibility
  - [x] Validate smooth transitions between targeting states

**Design Specifications:**
- **WeaponRenderState Enum**: HIDDEN (sheathed/slung/holstered), READY (default position), ATTACKING (aiming/firing/recovering)
- **State Mapping**: Clear mapping from WeaponState strings to WeaponRenderState enum values
- **Visual Consistency**: Weapons should always be visible when character is combat-ready
- **User Interface**: Improved visual feedback during automatic targeting scenarios
- **Performance Requirements**: No impact on rendering performance
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to READY state for unknown weapon states

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `GameRenderer.java`, `Character.java`, create `WeaponRenderState.java`
- **New Classes/Enums**: `WeaponRenderState` enum in combat package
- **Database/Save Changes**: None - rendering logic only
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains existing weapon state machine, only changes rendering logic

**WEAPON RENDERING DECISIONS:**
- **No-Target Behavior**: Change design so weapons show aiming at last target when currentTarget becomes null
- **Ready vs Attacking Visual Difference**: States are visually different positions/orientations
- **State Mapping Logic**: WeaponRenderState determined purely from WeaponState strings
- **Automatic Targeting Fix Scope**: Apply weapon visibility fixes to all characters, not just automatic targeting users
- **Edge Cases**: Show weapons in READY state even for incapacitated, reloading, or special state characters

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Documentation + Save System**: README.md should document save file behavior and testing approach
- **Save System + Weapon Rendering**: Saved firing modes should work correctly with weapon render states
- **Weapon Rendering + Automatic Targeting**: Clear weapon visibility during automatic targeting transitions
- **Priority Conflicts**: Visual improvements take precedence over performance optimizations
- **Save Data Coordination**: All character and weapon combat settings must be saved atomically

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Project Documentation**: Foundation for project understanding (high priority)
2. **Save File Enhancement**: Essential for combat scenario testing (high priority)
3. **Weapon Render State System**: Visual improvement and code clarity (medium priority)

**INTEGRATION DECISIONS:**
- **Development Order**: Systems can be implemented in any order since they're mostly independent
- **Testing Dependencies**: Save system and weapon rendering can be tested independently
- **README Content Timing**: Focus on current system state with general information, not specific new features

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`README.md`** - Create comprehensive project documentation
- **`CharacterData.java`** - Add usesAutomaticTargeting and preferredFiringMode fields
- **`SaveGameController.java`** - Update save/load logic for new character preference fields
- **`GameRenderer.java`** - Refactor to use WeaponRenderState enum
- **`Character.java`** - Update automatic targeting weapon visibility logic and implement firing mode preferences

**New Components Required:**
- **WeaponRenderState enum**: Defines weapon visual states
- **README.md**: Project documentation with personal and technical content

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Save Game Action** → **Enhanced Data Collection** → **Complete Combat State Serialization**
2. **Load Game Action** → **State Restoration** → **Combat Settings Reconstruction**
3. **Weapon State Change** → **Render State Determination** → **Visual State Update**
4. **Automatic Targeting** → **Weapon Visibility Logic** → **Ready State Display**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal increase for additional save data fields
- **CPU Usage**: Minor impact from enum-based rendering logic
- **Rendering Impact**: No expected performance degradation
- **Save File Size**: Small increase due to additional character/weapon fields
