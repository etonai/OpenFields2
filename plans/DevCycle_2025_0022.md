# Bug Fixes and Cleanup - DevCycle 2025_0022
*Created: 2025-06-24 | Last Design Update: [Date] | Last Implementation Update: [Date] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview

This development cycle takes an iterative approach to address bugs, technical debt, and cleanup tasks that emerged from or were discovered during DevCycle 21 (JavaFX Entity Decoupling). Unlike typical cycles that plan multiple features upfront, DevCycle 22 will work on one issue at a time in an iterative fashion: identify bug → plan fix → implement → test → commit → identify next issue.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix compilation and runtime issues discovered post-DevCycle 21
- Address test suite failures and incompatibilities with new interface architecture
- Clean up code quality issues and technical debt
- Improve system stability and performance
- Enhance developer experience and maintainability

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 21 completed (JavaFX entity decoupling)
- Project compiles successfully in main production code
- Working understanding of new interface-based architecture

**Estimated Complexity:** Variable - Individual issues range from Low to Medium complexity, but total scope depends on issues discovered

## Iterative Process Framework

### Issue Identification Process
1. **Automated Discovery**: Run compilation, tests, static analysis tools
2. **Manual Review**: Code review, runtime testing, performance monitoring  
3. **Documentation Review**: Check for outdated documentation or inconsistencies
4. **User Experience Testing**: Verify all features work as expected with new architecture

### Issue Prioritization Matrix
**Priority 1 (Critical)**: Compilation failures, runtime crashes, data loss bugs
**Priority 2 (High)**: Test failures, major functionality broken, performance regressions
**Priority 3 (Medium)**: Minor bugs, code quality issues, documentation problems
**Priority 4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, optimization opportunities, nice-to-have improvements

### Implementation Workflow (Per Issue)
1. **Issue Analysis** - Understand root cause and scope
2. **Solution Design** - Plan minimal, focused fix
3. **Implementation** - Code the solution
4. **Testing** - Verify fix works and doesn't break anything else
5. **Documentation** - Update relevant docs if needed
6. **Commit** - Single focused commit per issue
7. **Next Issue** - Move to highest priority remaining issue

## Current Known Issues

### Task List

#### Task #1: InputManager.java Unused Methods Cleanup ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Status**: Removed unused and obsolete methods identified by IntelliJ warnings
  - **Analysis Reference**: See `analysis/InputManager_Unused_Methods_Analysis.md`
  - **Priority 1 (Immediate)**: ✅ Removed 3 legacy/delegation methods
  - **Priority 2 (Verify)**: ✅ Removed 4 unused display/utility methods  
  - **Priority 3 (Refactor)**: ✅ Removed 6 delegation wrapper methods
  - **Priority 4 (Evaluate)**: ⚠️ Character creation methods preserved (may still be used)
  - **Actual Impact**: 10.2% code reduction (181 lines), improved maintainability
  - **File**: `src/main/java/InputManager.java` (1,775 → 1,594 lines)

#### Task #2: Melee Combat Auto Targeting Bug ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Status**: Fixed infinite loop preventing melee auto targeting from working
  - **Priority**: High (P2) - Combat functionality broken
  - **Symptoms**: Manual melee combat works correctly, but auto targeting melee combat fails to execute
  - **Impact**: Affects melee combat usability and automated combat scenarios
  - **Root Cause**: `currentTarget` was never assigned to `newTarget` after target acquisition, causing endless invalidation cycles
  - **Solution**: Added single line `currentTarget = newTarget;` in Character.java line 2175
  - **Files Modified**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
  - **Debug Output**:
    ```
    Selected: 1002:Chris | Health: 41/41 | Weapon: Colt Peacemaker | State: holstered | Pos: (400.0, 100.0)
    *** Debug mode ENABLED ***
    [COMBAT-MODE] 1002:Chris toggling from RANGED to MELEE
    [COMBAT-MODE] Melee weapon: Battle Axe
    [COMBAT-MODE] Ranged weapon: null
    [COMBAT-MODE] Melee weapon reach: 7.00 feet
    [COMBAT-MODE] Reset weapon state from holstered to sheathed (melee initial state)
    *** 1002:Chris switched to Melee Combat mode
    *** 1002:Chris automatic targeting ENABLED ***
    ***********************
    *** Game resumed
    ***********************
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris current target invalid, searching for new target...
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris searching 6 units for targets...
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG]   1000:Alice - not hostile (faction 1 vs 1)

    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris found 3 hostile units, selected: 1001:Bobby
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris current target invalid, searching for new target...
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris searching 6 units for targets...
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG]   1000:Alice - not hostile (faction 1 vs 1)
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG]   1004:Ethan - not hostile (faction 1 vs 1)
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris found 3 hostile units, selected: 1001:Bobby
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris current target invalid, searching for new target...
    ```
  - **Analysis**: Auto targeting found targets but repeatedly invalidated them due to missing assignment

#### Task #3: Melee Auto Targeting Unauthorized Disengagement ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Status**: Fixed overly restrictive distance check in melee auto targeting
  - **Priority**: High (P2) - Auto targeting functionality broken
  - **Symptoms**: Characters disengage from melee auto targeting when targets are "too far away"
  - **Impact**: Prevents effective melee auto targeting, characters give up on reachable targets
  - **Root Cause**: Hardcoded 50-foot pursuit limit was too restrictive for auto-selected targets
  - **Solution**: Increased pursuit range from 50 feet to 300 feet (100 yards) in Character.java line 2333
  - **Files Modified**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
  - **Debug Output**:
    ```
    [AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG] 1002:Chris found 3 hostile units, selected: 1003:Drake
    [AUTO-RETARGET] 1002:Chris acquired new target 1003:Drake at distance 65.1 feet
    [MELEE-MOVEMENT] 1002:Chris target 1003:Drake too far away (65.13 feet) - cancelling pursuit
    ```
  - **Analysis**: Auto targeting acquires target but melee movement logic cancels pursuit due to overly restrictive 50-foot limit
  - **Fix Details**: Changed `maxPursuitRange = 50.0` to `maxPursuitRange = 300.0` (100 yards)

#### Task #4: Melee Weapons Not Rendering Correctly ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Status**: Fixed weapon rendering to display correct weapon based on combat mode
  - **Priority**: Medium (P3) - Visual inconsistency affecting user experience
  - **Symptoms**: Character appears to hold ranged weapon (e.g., pistol) while in melee combat mode
  - **Expected Behavior**: Character should display melee weapon (e.g., axe, sword) when in melee combat mode
  - **Root Cause**: Weapon rendering always used legacy `weapon` field instead of checking combat mode
  - **Solution**: Modified renderWeapon() to use `meleeWeapon` or `rangedWeapon` based on `isMeleeCombatMode`
  - **Files Modified**: `src/main/java/GameRenderer.java`
  - **Impact**: Players now see correct weapon visual feedback for current combat mode
  - **Technical Implementation**: Added combat mode detection logic with fallback to legacy weapon field

#### Task #5: Add State Information to Melee Weapons ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Status**: Implemented state-based system for melee weapons similar to ranged weapons
  - **Priority**: Low (P4) - Enhancement for consistency and future flexibility
  - **Implementation**: Successfully converted melee weapons to state-based timing system with full backward compatibility
  - **State Flow**: `sheathed` → `unsheathing` → `melee_ready` → `melee_attacking` → `melee_recovering`
  - **Benefits Achieved**: Unified state management, consistency with ranged weapons, foundation for complex melee behaviors
  - **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Preserved - legacy timing properties maintained as fallback
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/melee-weapons.json` (added states to all weapons)
    - `src/main/resources/data/themes/civil_war/melee-weapons.json` (added states to all weapons)
    - `src/main/java/combat/MeleeWeapon.java` (state initialization and timing methods)
    - `src/main/java/data/MeleeWeaponData.java` (added states field)
    - `src/main/java/EditModeManager.java` (state parsing and initialization)
    - `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` (updated to use state-based timing)
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - **✅ JSON Schema**: Added `states` arrays mapping legacy timing to state transitions
    - **✅ State Methods**: Added `getStateBasedAttackSpeed()`, `getStateBasedAttackCooldown()`, `getStateBasedReadyingTime()`
    - **✅ Loader Integration**: Modified `createMeleeWeapon()` to parse states and initialize weapons
    - **✅ Combat Integration**: Updated combat system to use state-based timing with legacy fallback
    - **✅ Compatibility**: All timing values preserved exactly - state timing matches legacy properties

*[Issues will be added and tracked here as they are worked on]*

### Completed Issues

#### Issue #1: InputManager.java Unused Methods Cleanup ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: P3 (Medium) | **File**: `src/main/java/InputManager.java`
**Analysis Reference**: `analysis/InputManager_Unused_Methods_Analysis.md`

**Methods Removed**:
- **Priority 1** (3 methods): `legacyValidateComponentIntegrity()`, `handleScenarioNameInput()`, `promptForThemeSelection()`
- **Priority 2** (4 methods): `displayEnhancedCharacterStats()`, `displayMultiCharacterSelection()`, `getFactionDisplayName()`, `generateRandomCharacterForFaction()`
- **Priority 3** (6 methods): Character deployment and victory outcome delegation wrappers

**Impact**:
- **Lines Reduced**: 181 lines (10.2% reduction)
- **File Size**: 1,775 → 1,594 lines
- **Status**: All removals successful, compilation passes
- **Risk**: Low - removed only unused/duplicate methods

**Testing**:
- ✅ `mvn compile` - Success
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API
- ✅ Removed only private unused methods and pure delegation wrappers

#### Issue #2: Melee Combat Auto Targeting Infinite Loop ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: P2 (High) | **File**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Auto targeting logic in `automaticTargeting()` method found valid targets
- Target acquisition assigned `newTarget` but never set `currentTarget = newTarget`
- Target validation on next cycle found `currentTarget` still null, triggering new search
- Created infinite loop: find target → validate → fail → search again

**Solution Implemented**:
```java
// Added at line 2175 in Character.java
currentTarget = newTarget; // DevCycle 22: Fix auto targeting infinite loop by setting currentTarget
```

**Impact**:
- **Lines Added**: 1 line of code
- **Bug Severity**: High - completely broke melee auto targeting functionality
- **Testing**: ✅ Compilation successful, logic verified through debug analysis

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ `mvn compile` - Success
- ✅ Logic fix verified - target assignment now prevents infinite loop
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing combat systems

#### Issue #3: Melee Auto Targeting Overly Restrictive Distance Check ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: P2 (High) | **File**: `src/main/java/combat/Character.java`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Melee movement logic had hardcoded 50-foot maximum pursuit range
- Auto targeting could select targets beyond 50 feet (e.g., 65.1 feet)
- When movement completed but target still out of range, pursuit was cancelled
- Created disconnect between auto targeting selection and pursuit capability

**Solution Implemented**:
```java
// Changed at line 2333 in Character.java
double maxPursuitRange = 300.0; // Maximum pursuit range: 100 yards (300 feet)
```

**Impact**:
- **Change**: Increased pursuit range from 50 feet to 300 feet (100 yards)
- **Behavior**: Characters now pursue auto-selected targets up to realistic combat distances
- **Testing**: ✅ Compilation successful, logic validates reasonable pursuit limits

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ `mvn compile` - Success
- ✅ Distance check maintains reasonable limit while allowing effective auto targeting
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing melee combat systems

#### Issue #4: Weapon Rendering Combat Mode Mismatch ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: P3 (Medium) | **File**: `src/main/java/GameRenderer.java`

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Weapon rendering logic always used legacy `unit.character.weapon` field
- Did not check `isMeleeCombatMode` to determine which weapon type to display
- Characters in melee mode continued showing ranged weapon visually
- Created disconnect between actual combat mode and visual feedback

**Solution Implemented**:
```java
// Added combat mode detection in renderWeapon() method
Weapon weaponToRender;
if (unit.character.isMeleeCombatMode && unit.character.meleeWeapon != null) {
    weaponToRender = unit.character.meleeWeapon;
} else if (!unit.character.isMeleeCombatMode && unit.character.rangedWeapon != null) {
    weaponToRender = unit.character.rangedWeapon;
} else {
    weaponToRender = unit.character.weapon; // Fallback to legacy field
}
```

**Impact**:
- **Visual Accuracy**: Characters now display correct weapon for their current combat mode
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback about which weapon type is active
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback to legacy weapon field maintains compatibility
- **Testing**: ✅ Compilation successful, rendering logic enhanced

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ `mvn compile` - Success
- ✅ Combat mode detection properly selects appropriate weapon for rendering
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing weapon rendering system

#### Issue #5: Melee Weapon State System Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: P4 (Low) | **Files**: Multiple (6 files modified)

**Goal Analysis**:
- Convert melee weapons from individual timing properties to unified state-based system
- Achieve consistency with ranged weapon state management architecture
- Preserve full backward compatibility with existing timing behavior

**Implementation Phases Completed**:
1. **JSON Schema Design**: Added `states` arrays to all 10 melee weapons across both themes
2. **MeleeWeapon Enhancement**: Added state initialization and helper methods for state-based timing
3. **Data Layer Updates**: Enhanced MeleeWeaponData with states field for JSON parsing
4. **Factory Integration**: Modified weapon creation to parse and initialize states
5. **Combat System Integration**: Updated timing calculations to use state-based methods with fallback

**Technical Architecture**:
```java
// State-based timing with backward compatibility
public int getStateBasedAttackSpeed() {
    if (hasStates()) {
        WeaponState attackingState = getStateByName("melee_attacking");
        if (attackingState != null) return attackingState.ticks;
    }
    return attackSpeed; // Legacy fallback
}
```

**State Flow Implemented**:
- `sheathed` (0 ticks) → `unsheathing` (readyingTime) → `melee_ready` (15 ticks) → `melee_attacking` (attackSpeed) → `melee_recovering` (attackCooldown) → `melee_ready`

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ All timing values match between state and legacy systems
- ✅ `mvn compile` - Success with zero breaking changes
- ✅ Backward compatibility verified through timing value comparison
- ✅ State-based weapons and legacy weapons behave identically

**Impact**:
- **Consistency**: Melee and ranged weapons now use identical state management architecture
- **Flexibility**: Foundation for complex melee behaviors (combos, charging, special attacks)
- **Maintainability**: Unified timing system reduces code duplication and complexity
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for advanced melee weapon features in future development cycles
