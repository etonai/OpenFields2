# DevCycle 2025-0013 Bug Report #1
*Created: 2025-06-20 at 10:55 PM PDT*

## Bug Description

**Manual-To-Auto targeting transition still does not work**

After implementing the initial fix in DevCycle 13, the manual-to-auto targeting transition is still not functioning correctly. When a character performs a manual attack and then has auto-targeting enabled via SHIFT+T, the auto-targeting does not activate.

## Sample Output

```
Selected: 1:Alice
Health: 60/60, Faction: Red, Weapon: Uzi Submachine Gun, Position: Standing
Movement: Walk, Aiming: Normal, Hesitation: 0.0s (Wound: 0.0s, Bravery: 0.0s)

Movement: Walk, Aiming: Normal, Hesitation: 0.0s (Wound: 0.0s, Bravery: 0.0s)
*** 1000:Alice automatic targeting ENABLED
```

## Analysis

From the output, we can see:

1. **Manual Attack Sequence**: Alice performs a manual attack on Drake with her Uzi Submachine Gun
2. **Attack Completion**: The attack completes normally (weapon states: unsling → ready → aiming → firing → recovering → aiming)
3. **Auto-Targeting Enabled**: Auto-targeting is successfully enabled via SHIFT+T ("*** 1000:Alice automatic targeting ENABLED")
4. **No Follow-up**: Despite auto-targeting being enabled and the target (Drake) still being available, no automatic attack occurs

## Expected Behavior

After auto-targeting is enabled:
1. Alice should detect Drake as a valid target
2. Alice should automatically engage Drake with continuous attacks
3. Auto-targeting should continue until Drake is incapacitated or out of range

## Technical Investigation Required

1. **State Analysis**: Check if Alice's weapon state is blocking auto-targeting activation
2. **Target Validation**: Verify that Drake is still considered a valid target for auto-targeting
3. **Timing Issues**: Investigate if there are timing conflicts between manual attack completion and auto-targeting evaluation
4. **Debug Output**: Add more detailed logging to understand why auto-targeting isn't triggering

## Current Implementation Status

The current fix in `checkContinuousAttack()` method (line 1848-1849) was intended to address this issue by allowing auto-targeting evaluation after manual attacks. However, the bug persists, indicating the fix may be incomplete or the issue lies elsewhere in the auto-targeting pipeline.

## Priority

**High** - This bug significantly impacts the user experience and makes the auto-targeting system unreliable for tactical gameplay.

## Bug #2: Character Facing Not Updated During Movement

### Description

When a character is moving while auto-targeting, the character starts by facing the target correctly but does not recalculate the facing direction as the shooter moves. The character maintains the initial facing direction even when their relative position to the target changes significantly.

### Example Scenario

1. **Initial Setup**: Target is directly south of the attacker
2. **Auto-targeting Starts**: Attacker correctly faces south toward target
3. **Movement Occurs**: Attacker moves east while continuing to auto-target
4. **Problem**: Attacker continues facing south even though target is now southwest relative to new position

### Expected Behavior

The character should continuously update their facing direction to point toward the target as they move, maintaining accurate target orientation throughout the movement and combat sequence.

### Technical Analysis

This suggests that the fix implemented in `Unit.update()` (lines 117-120) successfully prevents movement direction from overriding target facing, but there's no mechanism to recalculate the target facing as the character's position changes during movement.

The current logic only sets target facing once when auto-targeting begins, but doesn't update it as the character moves to new positions.

### Priority

**Medium** - Affects visual realism and tactical accuracy but doesn't prevent combat functionality.

## Bug #3: Melee Auto-Targeting Stops After Attack

### Description

Melee auto-targeting is still not working correctly after the initial fix. When a character in auto-targeting mode attacks a target in melee combat, the auto-targeting stops after the first attack, regardless of whether the attack hits or misses. The character does not continue attacking even though the target is still alive and within range.

### Sample Output

```

### Analysis

From the output, we can observe:

1. **Auto-targeting Enabled**: Alice successfully has auto-targeting enabled for melee combat
2. **Target Acquisition**: Alice correctly acquires Drake as a target at distance 42.9 feet
3. **Successful Attack**: Alice executes a melee attack that hits Drake, causing 35 damage (Drake health: 35/70)
4. **Target Still Valid**: Drake is still alive (35/70 health) and should be a valid target for continued attacks
5. **No Follow-up**: Despite the target being alive and auto-targeting enabled, no subsequent attacks occur

### Technical Investigation

The issue appears to be that while the `isAttacking = false` flag is correctly set in the melee recovery event (as implemented in the original fix), the auto-targeting system is not properly re-evaluating and continuing attacks after the first melee attack completes.

Possible causes:
1. **Weapon State Issues**: The recovery to `melee_ready` state may not be triggering correctly
2. **Auto-targeting Loop**: The `updateAutomaticTargeting()` method may not be called frequently enough or may be blocked by other conditions
3. **Target Validation**: The target validation logic may be failing after the first attack
4. **Timing Issues**: There may be timing conflicts between attack completion and auto-targeting re-evaluation

### Expected Behavior

After the first melee attack hits Drake:
1. Alice should complete the attack recovery cycle
2. Auto-targeting should re-evaluate and detect Drake as still valid (alive, in range)
3. Alice should automatically initiate a second melee attack
4. This cycle should continue until Drake is incapacitated or moves out of range

### Priority

**High** - This bug makes melee auto-targeting essentially non-functional, significantly impacting gameplay.

## Implementation Status

### Bug #1 (Manual-to-Auto Transition): ✅ **FIXED**
**Fixes Implemented:**
1. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to `updateAutomaticTargeting()` method
2. ✅ Enhanced `checkContinuousAttack()` to delegate to `updateAutomaticTargeting()` when auto-targeting is enabled but no current target exists
3. ✅ Added debug logging to trace the complete auto-targeting call chain
4. ✅ Fixed the core issue: `checkContinuousAttack()` now properly handles the case where manual attacks clear `currentTarget` but auto-targeting is enabled

**Root Cause Found:** After manual attacks, `checkContinuousAttack()` was returning early when `currentTarget == null`, even when auto-targeting was enabled. The fix delegates to `updateAutomaticTargeting()` in this scenario.

### Bug #2 (Dynamic Facing During Movement): ✅ **FIXED**
**Fixes Implemented:**
1. ✅ Modified `Unit.update()` to continuously update target facing during movement when auto-targeting is active
2. ✅ Added logic to recalculate facing direction toward auto-targeting target as character position changes
3. ✅ Maintained performance by only updating facing when actively auto-targeting with a target

**Implementation:** Characters now call `setTargetFacing(character.currentTarget.x, character.currentTarget.y)` during movement when auto-targeting is active.

### Bug #3 (Melee Auto-Targeting Continuation): ✅ **FIXED**
**Fixes Implemented:**
1. ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Added `loadMeleeWeaponTypes()` method to `DataManager` to load melee weapon state configurations
2. ✅ Enhanced debug logging in melee attack recovery to verify `isAttacking = false` is set
3. ✅ Added auto-targeting re-evaluation debug logging in melee recovery events
4. ✅ Fixed the fundamental issue: melee weapons now have proper state definitions loaded

**Root Cause Found:** The `DataManager` only loaded ranged weapon types, not melee weapon types, causing all melee weapons to have "NO STATES LOADED". This prevented proper state management and recovery event scheduling.

## Document Review Analysis

### Critical Observations

#### Bug #1 Analysis Enhancement Needed
1. **Weapon State Investigation**: The output shows Alice ends in "aiming" state after manual attack - this may be blocking auto-targeting since "aiming" could set `isAttacking = true`
2. **Missing Debug Output**: No `[AUTO-TARGET-DEBUG]` messages appear after auto-targeting is enabled, suggesting `updateAutomaticTargeting()` may not be executing at all
3. **Target Persistence**: Need to verify if `currentTarget` is preserved or cleared after manual attacks complete

#### Bug #2 Technical Gaps
1. **Update Frequency**: How often should target facing be recalculated during movement? Every tick vs. periodic updates for performance
2. **Integration Point**: Should facing updates occur in `Unit.update()`, `updateAutomaticTargeting()`, or a separate movement callback?
3. **Smooth Transition**: Need mechanism to prevent jarring facing changes when target moves slightly

#### Bug #3 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Critical Issue**: "NO STATES LOADED" for Steel Dagger indicates fundamental weapon configuration problem - may affect all melee weapons
2. **Emergency State Creation**: The "emergency ready state" suggests weapon state system is broken, which could prevent proper recovery event scheduling
3. **Missing Recovery Output**: No debug output showing melee recovery event execution or `isAttacking = false` being set

### Cross-Bug Patterns
1. **Common Thread**: All bugs involve auto-targeting not continuing/activating when it should
2. **Debug Logging Gap**: Insufficient logging to trace auto-targeting execution flow
3. **State Management**: Multiple issues with weapon state and attack flag management

### Implementation Priority Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Add comprehensive debug logging to all auto-targeting paths
2. **High**: Fix melee weapon state configuration (Bug #3 root cause)
3. **High**: Investigate why `updateAutomaticTargeting()` isn't executing after manual attacks (Bug #1)
4. **Medium**: Implement dynamic facing updates during movement (Bug #2)

### Additional Investigation Questions

#### Technical Architecture Questions
1. **Auto-targeting Call Frequency**: Is `updateAutomaticTargeting()` called every game tick for all units with `usesAutomaticTargeting = true`?
2. **Weapon State Dependencies**: Do weapon states like "aiming" automatically set `isAttacking = true`, and if so, when are they cleared?
3. **Event Queue Integration**: Are melee recovery events being properly scheduled and executed, or is the emergency state creation breaking the normal flow?
4. **Target Reference Management**: How is `currentTarget` managed between manual attacks and auto-targeting activation?

#### Debug Strategy Questions
5. **Logging Strategy**: Should we add debug flags to control verbosity of auto-targeting logging for easier debugging?
6. **State Validation**: What's the complete list of conditions that must be true for auto-targeting to execute an attack?
7. **Performance Impact**: What's the performance cost of adding dynamic facing updates during movement for multiple units?
8. **Weapon Configuration**: Are all melee weapons missing state definitions, or is this specific to certain weapons?
