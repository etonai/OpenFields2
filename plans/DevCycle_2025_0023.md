*Created: 2025-06-25 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-25 | Last Implementation Update: [Pending] | Implementation Status: PLANNING*

## Overview
This development cycle implements advanced defensive mechanics and skill system integration for melee combat. Building on the foundational melee combat system, this cycle adds automatic defense attempts, counter-attacks, and comprehensive skill progression tracking to create a rich tactical melee experience.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement automatic defense system with counter-attack opportunities
- Integrate melee weapon skills with character progression system
- Create comprehensive combat statistics tracking for skill advancement
- Enhance tactical depth without compromising existing melee combat flow

**Prerequisites:** 
- Completed foundational melee combat system (DevCycle 9 equivalent)
- Basic melee attacks, weapon switching, and combat modes functional
- Character stat system and weapon state management implemented

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium-High - Complex defensive mechanics and skill integration with extensive balancing requirements

**Special Considerations:**
- **Performance**: Not a concern for this implementation - focus on functionality over optimization
- **Save Compatibility**: Not required - breaking changes to save files are acceptable

## System Implementations

### 1. Defense System ⭕ **PLANNED**
- [ ] **Defensive State Machine**
  - [ ] Create DefenseState enum (ready, defending, cooldown)
  - [ ] Implement defense state manager independent of weapon states
  - [ ] Design defense availability logic (cannot defend while attacking/switching)
  - [ ] Add defense state tracking to Character class

- [ ] **Automatic Defense Mechanics**
  - [ ] Implement automatic defend attempt when targeted by melee attack
  - [ ] Create defend success calculation: Base 50% + Dexterity Modifier + (Weapon Skill Level × 5) + (defendScore / 2), no cap
  - [ ] Process defensive attempts immediately (not as scheduled events)
  - [ ] Add defense cooldown system using weapon-specific defenseCooldown attribute

- [ ] **Counter-Attack System**
  - [ ] Implement automatic counter-attack window (0.5-1 second) after successful defense
  - [ ] Create enhanced counter-attack timing (50% faster: attackSpeed × 0.5)
  - [ ] Use standard damage calculation for counter-attacks (no bonus)
  - [ ] Set defense state to COOLDOWN during counter-attacks
  - [ ] Integrate counter-attacks with standard event queue scheduling

**Design Specifications:**
- **Automatic Defense**: Characters automatically attempt to defend when attacked in melee
- **Defend Success Rate**: Base 50% + Dexterity Modifier + (Weapon Skill Level × 5) + (defendScore / 2), no maximum cap
- **Counter-Attack Window**: 0.5-1 second opportunity for automatic enhanced attack after successful defense
- **Counter-Attack Speed**: 50% faster than normal attacks (attackSpeed × 0.5)
- **Defense Cooldown**: Weapon-specific cooldown based on defenseCooldown attribute (default 60 ticks), starts on defense attempt
- **State Independence**: Defense state machine operates independently of weapon states for clean logic separation
- **Unified Defense Types**: Blocking, dodging, and parrying combined under single "defending" action
- **Visual Feedback**: Defense actions use same animation and visual effects as attacks (temporary solution)

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `Character.java`, `MeleeCombatResolver.java`, `CombatResolver.java`, `OpenFields2.java`
- **New Classes/Enums**: `DefenseState.java`, `DefenseSystem.java`
- **Database/Save Changes**: Add defense state and counter-attack timing to character save data
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Not required - save file breaking changes acceptable

### 2. Skill System Integration ⭕ **PLANNED**
- [ ] **Melee Weapon Skills**
  - [ ] Create melee weapon skill types (Knife, Tomahawk, Rifle melee)
  - [ ] Apply +5 accuracy per skill level (consistent with ranged weapons)
  - [ ] Implement skill-based defensive improvements
  - [ ] Add defenseCooldown attribute to all melee weapons (default: 60 ticks)

- [ ] **Combat Statistics Tracking**
  - [ ] Track meleeAttacksAttempted, meleeAttacksSuccessful by weapon type
  - [ ] Track meleeWoundsInflicted by severity level
  - [ ] Track defensiveAttempts, defensiveSuccesses
  - [ ] Implement skill experience gain from combat participation
  - [ ] Add counter-attack statistics tracking

- [ ] **Character Stat Integration**
  - [ ] Link Dexterity to melee attack accuracy and defense success
  - [ ] Connect Strength to melee damage output and counter-attack power
  - [ ] Tie Reflexes to defend success rate and counter-attack availability
  - [ ] Use existing Coolness for combat stress effects on skill performance

**Design Specifications:**
- **Skill Range**: Weapon skills range from 0-9 (consistent with ranged weapons)
- **Weapon Skills Available**: Knife, Tomahawk, Rifle (melee) skills
- **Skill Effects**: Apply melee weapon bonuses using same formula as ranged weapon bonuses
- **Defense Skills**: Weapon skills also improve defensive capabilities at same rate as offensive
- **Stat Integration**: All four core stats (Dexterity, Strength, Reflexes, Coolness) impact melee combat
- **Experience Gain**: Skill progression from combat attempts, successes, and wounds inflicted

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `Character.java`, `SkillsManager.java`, `CharacterData.java`
- **New Classes/Enums**: `CombatStatistics.java`, enhanced skill tracking methods
- **Database/Save Changes**: Expand character data with detailed combat statistics and skill progression
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Not required - skill data structure changes acceptable

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Defense System + Weapon States**: Defense state operates independently but respects weapon availability (cannot defend while switching weapons)
- **Skills + Defense Success**: Weapon skills improve both offensive accuracy and defensive success rates using same progression formula
- **Counter-Attacks + Event Queue**: Counter-attacks integrate with existing scheduled event system but have priority timing
- **Statistics + All Combat**: All melee combat actions contribute to skill progression and statistical tracking
- **Stat Modifiers + All Systems**: Character stats affect all aspects of melee combat through consistent modifier system

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Defense System**: Core defensive mechanics must be stable before counter-attacks (highest priority)
2. **Skill Integration**: Skill effects on combat must work before statistical tracking (high priority)
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Combat statistics important for progression but not critical for gameplay (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`src/main/java/Character.java`** - Add defense state, skill progression, combat statistics
- **`src/main/java/MeleeCombatResolver.java`** - Integrate defense mechanics and skill effects

*This development cycle transforms the basic melee combat system into a rich, tactical experience with defensive depth and meaningful character progression. The implementation prioritizes functionality and balance over performance optimization, creating a solid foundation for future tactical combat enhancements.*

## Melee System Integration Findings

Based on investigation of the current codebase, the defense system should integrate with these existing patterns:

### Existing Infrastructure
- **MeleeWeapon Class**: Already has `defendScore` attribute (1-100 scale) but it's currently unused
- **State Management**: Weapon states use proven state machine pattern (sheathed → unsheathing → melee_ready → melee_attacking)
- **Combat Resolution**: `CombatResolver.resolveMeleeAttack()` handles all melee combat calculations
- **Event Queue**: All combat actions scheduled through event queue with proper timing
- **Skill Integration**: Existing pattern uses +5 accuracy bonus per skill level (0-9 range)

### Integration Approach
1. **Defense State Independence**: Create separate DefenseState enum as specified, avoiding conflicts with weapon states
2. **Hook Points**: Modify `resolveMeleeAttack()` to check for defensive attempts before hit calculation
3. **Immediate Processing**: Defense attempts processed immediately (not scheduled) to maintain combat flow
4. **Counter-Attack Scheduling**: Use existing event queue for counter-attacks with priority timing
5. **Leverage Existing Patterns**: Use same skill bonus calculations and stat modifier formulas

### New Weapon Attribute
- **defenseCooldown**: Add to MeleeWeapon and MeleeWeaponData classes (default: 60 ticks for all weapons)

This approach maintains architectural consistency while adding the new defensive layer cleanly.

## Final Implementation Notes

Based on the approved recommendations, the defense system will:

1. **Use existing weapon skills** - Each weapon's `combatSkill` applies to both offensive and defensive bonuses
2. **Defense state during counter-attacks** - Characters cannot defend while executing counter-attacks, creating tactical windows
3. **Visual feedback** - Defensive actions will temporarily use attack animations and visual effects until dedicated defense animations are implemented
4. **Standard event scheduling** - Counter-attacks use normal event queue without special priority
5. **Consistent cooldown timing** - Defense cooldown starts immediately on defense attempt, regardless of success

No additional clarifications are needed at this time. The implementation can proceed with these specifications.
