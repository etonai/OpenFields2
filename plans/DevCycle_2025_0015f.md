# DevCycle 2025_0015f - Ranged Attack Movement Bug Fix

*Created: June 21, 2025 | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview

Fix critical bugs in the ranged combat system identified during testing. Two major issues prevent proper ranged combat functionality: characters incorrectly moving towards targets during ranged attacks (should remain stationary) and null pointer exceptions during weapon firing that break audio feedback.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix ranged attack movement bug - characters should stay stationary during ranged attacks
- Resolve null pointer exception in weapon sound callback system
- Maintain all existing melee combat functionality (characters should still move for melee)
- Ensure zero regressions in combat system functionality

**Prerequisites:**
- DevCycle 15e completed (InputManager refactoring operational)
- Combat system baseline established
- Audio system baseline established

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Critical bug fixes affecting core combat mechanics

## Bug Analysis Summary

### Critical Bug #1: Ranged Attack Movement Issue
**Problem**: Characters move towards targets during ranged attacks instead of staying stationary
**Expected**: Character remains in position during ranged weapon sequence
**Actual**: Character moves towards target as if initiating melee combat
**Impact**: Breaks fundamental ranged vs melee combat distinction

### Critical Bug #2: Null Pointer Exception in Audio
**Problem**: Game throws exception when weapon firing attempts to play sound
```
Exception: Cannot invoke "game.GameCallbacks.playWeaponSound(combat.Weapon)" 
because "gameCallbacks" is null at combat.Character.lambda$scheduleFiring$4(Character.java:1063)
```
**Impact**: Audio feedback lost, exception spam in console

### Evidence from Testing
```
Selected: 1:Alice
*** 1000:Alice targeting 1003:Drake for ranged attack ***
1000:Alice weapon state: unsling at tick 0
1000:Alice weapon state: ready at tick 86
1000:Alice weapon state: aiming at tick 101
1000:Alice weapon state: firing at tick 131
*** 1000:Alice fires a 9mm round from Uzi Submachine Gun (ammo remaining: 31)
[NULL POINTER EXCEPTION OCCURS]
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Null Pointer Exception Investigation and Fix (4 hours)

#### Step 1.1: Root Cause Analysis (1 hour)
**Objective**: Identify why `gameCallbacks` is null in Character instances

**Investigation Tasks:**
- Examine `Character.java:1063` and surrounding `scheduleFiring` lambda
- Trace `gameCallbacks` assignment in Character creation/initialization
- Check Character factory methods for callback assignment
- Review DevCycle 15e changes that might have affected callback chains

**Expected Findings:**
- Missing callback assignment during character creation
- Broken callback chain in refactored components
- Lambda capturing null reference at execution time

#### Step 1.2: Callback Assignment Fix (2 hours)
**Objective**: Ensure all Character instances receive proper gameCallbacks reference

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Add/fix gameCallbacks assignment in Character creation
- Verify callback assignment in CharacterFactory
- Add validation to prevent null callbacks
- Test callback chain from OpenFields2 through all components

**Success Criteria:**
- All Character instances have non-null gameCallbacks
- Weapon firing plays sounds without exceptions
- Callback chain validated through testing

#### Step 1.3: Defensive Programming (1 hour)
**Objective**: Add protection against future null callback issues

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Add null check before `gameCallbacks.playWeaponSound()` calls
- Add logging/warning for missing callbacks
- Implement graceful degradation when callbacks are missing

**Success Criteria:**
- No crashes even if callbacks become null
- Clear logging when callback issues occur
- Audio system remains stable

### Phase 2: Ranged Attack Movement Bug Investigation and Fix (6 hours)

#### Step 2.1: Combat Type Detection Analysis (2 hours)
**Objective**: Understand how ranged vs melee combat is determined and where it fails

**Investigation Tasks:**
- Trace combat initiation from CombatCommandProcessor to character movement
- Examine `isMeleeCombatMode` flag setting during ranged attacks
- Check combat type determination logic in combat command processing
- Review target assignment logic for ranged vs melee differentiation

**Expected Findings:**
- Combat mode not set correctly for ranged attacks
- Target assignment triggering unwanted movement
- Missing distinction between combat target and movement target

#### Step 2.2: Combat Mode Fix (2 hours)
**Objective**: Ensure ranged attacks properly set combat mode and prevent movement

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Fix `isMeleeCombatMode` setting for ranged attacks (should be false)
- Add explicit ranged combat validation in combat initiation
- Separate combat target assignment from movement target assignment
- Add movement restrictions during ranged weapon state transitions

**Success Criteria:**
- Characters remain stationary during ranged attacks
- `isMeleeCombatMode` correctly reflects attack type
- Combat targets don't trigger movement for ranged attacks

#### Step 2.3: Movement System Integration (2 hours)
**Objective**: Ensure movement system respects combat type distinctions

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Review `Unit.setTarget()` method for combat type awareness
- Add combat state checks in movement processing
- Prevent movement commands during ranged weapon state sequences
- Maintain melee combat movement functionality

**Success Criteria:**
- Ranged attacks: no movement, character stays in position
- Melee attacks: movement works as expected
- Combat state properly coordinated with movement system

### Phase 3: Integration Testing and Validation (4 hours)

#### Step 3.1: Functional Testing (2 hours)
**Objective**: Verify both bugs are fixed and no regressions introduced

**Test Cases:**
- **Ranged Attack Test**: Character initiates ranged attack, remains stationary throughout sequence
- **Melee Attack Test**: Character initiates melee attack, moves to target as expected
- **Audio Test**: Weapon sounds play correctly without exceptions during firing
- **Combat Transition Test**: Switching between ranged and melee modes works correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- All test cases pass without errors or exceptions
- Audio feedback works correctly for all weapon types
- Combat behavior matches expected ranged vs melee patterns

#### Step 3.2: Regression Testing (2 hours)
**Objective**: Ensure no existing functionality is broken by the fixes

**Test Procedures:**
- Run DevCycle 15b validation procedures
- Test multi-unit combat scenarios
- Test all weapon types (pistol, rifle, melee weapons)
- Test combat during different game states (paused, edit mode, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- DevCycle 15b tests pass completely
- All combat functionality preserved
- No performance degradation
- 60 FPS requirements maintained
