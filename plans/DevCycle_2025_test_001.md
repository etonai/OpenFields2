# DevCycle 2025-Test-001: Test Scenario System Development

## Overview

Incremental development of a test scenario system to provide predictable, repeatable combat situations for validation and debugging. This cycle focuses on building the foundation with simple scenarios and deterministic test characters.

## Development Tasks (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Foundation - Simple Sample Scenario
**Goal**: Create basic test scenario infrastructure
- [ ] Design simple test scenario format and data structure
- [ ] Implement basic scenario loading mechanism
- [ ] Create one sample scenario with existing characters
- [ ] Validate scenario can be loaded and executed manually

### Phase 2: Guaranteed Miss Character
**Goal**: Create deterministic test character that never hits
- [ ] Research current skill system limits and stat ranges
- [ ] Design character with minimum stats/skills for guaranteed misses
- [ ] Implement test character generation utilities
- [ ] Validate character never hits in combat scenarios
- [ ] Document character configuration for future reference

### Phase 3: Guaranteed Miss Scenarios
**Goal**: Test various combat systems with predictable miss outcomes
- [ ] **Basic Combat**: Single shot guaranteed miss scenario
- [ ] **Burst Mode**: Burst fire with guaranteed misses
- [ ] **Fire Mode Switching**: Multiple fire modes with misses
- [ ] **Reload Testing**: Extended combat requiring reloads
- [ ] **Auto-Targeting**: Automatic target acquisition with misses
- [ ] **Movement Penalties**: Moving shooter guaranteed miss scenarios

### Phase 4: Save System Integration (Optional)
**Goal**: Integrate test scenarios with save system
- [ ] Extend save system to support alphabetic keys (A-Z)
- [ ] Implement debug mode display logic for test scenarios
- [ ] Create test scenario save/load functionality
- [ ] Validate scenarios load correctly from save system

### Phase 5: Basic Automation (Optional)
**Goal**: Simple automated test execution
- [ ] Create basic test runner that can execute scenarios
- [ ] Implement simple pass/fail validation
- [ ] Generate basic test reports
- [ ] Document test execution process

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- One functional test scenario that can be manually loaded and run
- Basic scenario data structure defined and implemented
- Foundation for future scenario expansion established

### Phase 2 Success
- Test character that demonstrably never hits targets
- Character generation utilities for extreme stat configurations
- Documented approach for creating deterministic test characters

### Phase 3 Success
- At least 3 different guaranteed miss scenarios working
- Coverage of key combat systems (basic, burst, reload)
- Validated predictable behavior across multiple test runs

## Implementation Notes

### Incremental Approach
- Start with simplest possible implementation
- Build complexity gradually with each phase
- Each phase should produce working, testable results
- Later phases are optional and can be moved to future cycles

### Modular Design
- Test scenarios should be self-contained
- Character generation should be reusable
- Save system integration should not impact core game functionality
- Automation framework should be extensible

### Documentation Requirements
- Document all test character configurations
- Record scenario expected outcomes
- Maintain notes on combat system behaviors discovered during testing
- Create usage instructions for development team

## Future Cycle Preparation

### Test_002 Potential Tasks
- Perfect accuracy test characters
- More complex scenario types
- Full save system integration
- Advanced automation framework
- Statistical validation for variable scenarios

### Test_003 Potential Tasks
- Comprehensive scenario library
- Performance testing scenarios
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Advanced test reporting and analysis

## Dependencies

- Existing save/load system (for Phase 4)
- Current character creation system
- Debug configuration system (for save integration)
- Combat system (no modifications required)

## Research and Background

See `/analysis/Test_Scenarios_After_33.md` for detailed research notes, design decisions, and system constraints discovered during initial planning. This document contains important information about:
- Skill system limits and character stat ranges
- Combat system constraints (critical wounds, health mechanics)
- Save system integration requirements
- Comprehensive scenario planning and test character specifications

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Skill system constraints**: Research actual limits before character design
- **Save system complexity**: Keep integration simple, start with manual loading
- **Combat system changes**: Design scenarios to be resilient to minor system updates

### Scope Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to phase goals, move advanced features to future cycles
- **Perfect determinism**: Accept "very reliable" instead of "absolutely guaranteed" for initial implementation
- **Automation complexity**: Start with manual testing, add automation incrementally
