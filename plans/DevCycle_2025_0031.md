*Created: 2025-06-29 at 16:05 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-29 at 16:05 | Last Implementation Update: [TBD] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on continued Character.java size reduction and architectural improvements building on the foundation established in DevCycles 29-30. We will implement targeted improvements one task at a time to maintain stability while achieving meaningful progress.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Continue reducing Character.java line count using established manager architecture
- Implement one improvement at a time with testing between each change
- Maintain all existing functionality and backward compatibility
- Build upon DevCycle 30's manager foundation (CharacterSkillsManager, CharacterStatsManager, TargetManager)

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 30 successfully completed and merged to main
- Manager infrastructure established and functional
- Application compiling and running without critical bugs
- Character.java currently at 2,453 lines (target: continue reduction toward 2,000 lines)

**Estimated Complexity:** Low - Iterative approach with single-task implementation cycles

## Available Task Options

### Option 1: Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Target**: Extract ~60+ line method to CombatCoordinator following DevCycle 30 patterns

**Achieved Benefits:**
- Substantial line reduction (47 lines saved: 2,453 → 2,406 lines)
- Consistency with startAttackSequence extraction from DevCycle 30
- Low risk - well-defined method boundaries
- Follows established delegation patterns

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ Created `startMeleeAttackSequenceInternal()` method in CombatCoordinator with full 51-line logic
- ✅ Updated Character to delegate `scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState` calls to CombatCoordinator
- ✅ Made supporting methods public for CombatCoordinator access
- ✅ Maintained parameter compatibility and method signatures
- ✅ Tested melee combat functionality - application compiles and runs successfully

**Files Modified:**
- `CombatCoordinator.java`: Added startMeleeAttackSequenceInternal() method (53 lines added)
- `Character.java`: Converted scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState() to delegation (47 lines removed)
- Made `scheduleMeleeStateTransition()`, `scheduleMeleeAttack()`, `calculateAttackSpeedMultiplier()` public

### Option 2: Extract scheduleFiring Method ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Target**: Extract ~125 line method to CombatCoordinator following DevCycle 30 patterns

**Achieved Benefits:**
- Massive line reduction (121 lines saved: 2,406 → 2,285 lines) - largest single extraction in DevCycle 31
- Architectural consistency with DevCycle 30 combat method extractions
- Complex combat orchestration logic moved to appropriate coordinator
- Centralizes firing sequence management with other combat coordination

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ Created `scheduleFiringInternal()` method in CombatCoordinator with full 125-line logic
- ✅ Updated Character to delegate `scheduleFiring` calls to CombatCoordinator
- ✅ Added missing imports (ScheduledEvent, Unit) to CombatCoordinator
- ✅ Made `checkContinuousAttack()` method public for proper access
- ✅ Tested ranged combat functionality - application compiles and runs successfully

**Files Modified:**
- `CombatCoordinator.java`: Added scheduleFiringInternal() method (127 lines added)
- `Character.java`: Converted scheduleFiring() to delegation (121 lines removed)
- Made `checkContinuousAttack()` public

**Method Analysis:**
- **Size**: 125 lines (lines 1714-1838) - largest method in Character.java
- **Complexity**: Very high - handles console output, weapon state transitions, ammunition management, audio/visual effects, projectile scheduling, burst fire integration, multiple shot sequences, recovery states, and reload triggering
- **Manager Integration**: Already uses BurstFireManager and AimingSystem - should be coordinated by CombatCoordinator
- **Usage**: Called from 2 locations in Character.java for firing sequence management
- **Risk**: Medium-High due to complexity, but follows proven DevCycle 30 extraction patterns

## Current Task Selection

**TASK 1 COMPLETED:** Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method successfully implemented.
**TASK 2 COMPLETED:** Extract scheduleFiring Method successfully implemented.

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method** - COMPLETED (47 lines saved)
2. ✅ **Extract scheduleFiring Method** - COMPLETED (121 lines saved)

**DevCycle 31 Results:**
- **Total Line Reduction**: 168 lines (2,453 → 2,285 lines)
- **Both Major Tasks Completed**: All planned DevCycle 31 objectives achieved
- **Application Status**: Fully functional, compiled and tested successfully

### Option 3: Extract checkContinuousAttack Method
**Target**: Extract ~70 line method to CombatCoordinator following DevCycle 30 patterns

**Rationale for Extraction:**
- **Behavioral Logic**: Contains complex combat flow logic rather than simple data access
- **Manager Pattern Fit**: Aligns with established combat manager architecture - could belong in AttackFlowManager or CombatCoordinator
- **Already Partially Extracted**: CombatCoordinator calls `character.checkContinuousAttack()` at line 383, indicating incomplete refactoring
- **Heavy Dependencies**: Orchestrates multiple systems (event scheduling, target management, weapon state, auto-targeting)
- **Complex Control Flow**: Contains sophisticated decision trees better managed by combat coordinator

**Method Analysis:**
- **Size**: ~70 lines (lines 2057-2124) with complex logic
- **Complexity**: High - handles target validity, combat state transitions, auto-targeting decisions, attack continuation
- **Current Usage**: Called from CombatCoordinator.scheduleFiringInternal() but still delegates back to Character
- **Integration**: Coordinates with BurstFireManager, AutoTargetingSystem, event scheduling
- **Risk**: Medium - complex method but well-defined boundaries

**Extraction Approach:**
- Move to CombatCoordinator as `handleAttackContinuation()` method
- Complete the partial refactoring already started
- Handle attack sequence management, target reassessment, combat mode transitions
- Remove another 70+ lines of behavioral logic from Character

**Benefits:**
- Completes architectural refactoring pattern
- Centralizes attack flow management in CombatCoordinator
- Significant line reduction from Character.java
- Removes complex behavioral logic from data-focused Character class

**Next Steps:** DevCycle 31 ready for closure or additional task consideration based on user preference.

**Implementation Process Completed:**
1. ✅ User selected Task 1 - implemented successfully
2. ✅ User selected Task 2 - implemented successfully 
3. ✅ All changes committed and functionality verified
4. ✅ Both major planned tasks completed with excellent results
5. ✅ Character.java successfully reduced by 168 lines total
