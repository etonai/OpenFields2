# Iterative Development Cycle - DevCycle 2025_0038
*Created: July 2, 2025 at 6:38 PM | Last Design Update: July 3, 2025 at 10:25 PM | Last Implementation Update: July 3, 2025 at 12:50 AM | Implementation Status: ⭕ **ALL CURRENT SYSTEMS COMPLETE***

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on fixing test bugs and improving test stability. The cycle will address failing tests, test infrastructure issues, and related testing problems discovered through continuous integration and testing analysis.

**IMPORTANT ITERATIVE CYCLE PRINCIPLES:**
- **One System at a Time**: Focus completely on implementing one system before considering the next
- **No Future Planning**: Do NOT plan future systems while working on the current system
- **No Premature Implementation**: Do NOT implement systems before they are fully planned
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete each system fully (including testing) before moving to the next
- **Flexible Scope**: Systems 2+ are defined only after System 1 is complete
- **Empty Placeholders**: Future system sections must contain no hints about what those systems should cover
- **⚠️ CYCLE NEVER COMPLETE UNTIL CLOSED**: Even when all planned systems are finished, the cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix failing test bugs and improve test reliability
- Implement additional test improvements and bug fixes as needed
- Enhance test coverage and validation for affected components
- Address any additional testing issues discovered during iterative development

**Prerequisites:** 
- Access to current test suite and ability to run `mvn test`
- Understanding of existing test failures and patterns

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Multiple independent test fixes with varying complexity levels

- **Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced test stability and reliability for continuous integration

### Files Modified
*Updated during System 1, System 2, and System 3 implementation*

**System 1 Files:**
- `/factions/1.json` - Updated "headshotsKills" → "headshotIncapacitations" (multiple instances)
- `/factions/2.json` - Updated "headshotsKills" → "headshotIncapacitations" (multiple instances)  
- `/saves/test_b.json` - Updated "headshotsKills" → "headshotIncapacitations" (multiple instances)
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added mandatory GunfightTestAutomated rule and updated closure checklist

**System 2 Files:**
- `/saves/test_a.json` - Updated "headshotsKills" → "headshotIncapacitations" (multiple instances)
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Expanded critical test requirements to include BasicMissTestAutomated and BasicMissTestSimple

**System 3 Files:**
- `/src/main/resources/config/game-config.json` - Created game configuration file with window dimensions and display settings
- `/src/main/java/config/GameConfig.java` - Created configuration loading system with JSON parsing and error handling
- `/src/main/java/OpenFields2.java` - Integrated configuration system with JavaFX application startup

**System 6 Files:**
- `/factions/TestFactionAlpha.json` - Added SoldierAlpha character with Springfield 1861 musket and careful aiming speed
- `/factions/TestFactionBeta.json` - Added SoldierBeta character with Springfield 1861 musket and careful aiming speed
- `/saves/test_c.json` - Created 2v2 Springfield combat save with proper character positioning (allies 4 feet apart, enemies 100 feet apart)
- `/src/test/java/SpringfieldTestAutomated.java` - Complete test implementation with team-based victory conditions, careful aiming setup, and 5-minute timeout
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added SpringfieldTestAutomated to Critical Test Requirements section

### Lessons Learned
*Updated after System 3 completion*

- **Data Migration Impact**: Code field name changes require corresponding updates to ALL persisted data files, not just some
- **Test Data Maintenance**: Test fixture files need careful maintenance when data models evolve - both faction and save files affected
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Changes affecting data serialization should include verification of all test data files across different test scenarios
- **Test Coverage**: Multiple test suites can be affected by the same underlying data issues - fix systematically
- **Critical Test Importance**: Having mandatory tests prevents regressions from breaking core functionality
- **Configuration System Design**: JSON-based configuration provides flexibility and maintainability for application settings
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Configuration systems should always provide sensible defaults when files are missing or invalid
- **Integration Testing**: New configuration systems must be verified against existing critical tests to ensure no regressions

# Completion workflow (ONLY when cycle closure is explicitly ordered)
# ⚠️ DO NOT RUN UNTIL EXPLICITLY TOLD TO CLOSE THE CYCLE ⚠️
git checkout main
git merge DC_38
git branch -d DC_38
```

### Commit Message Format
- **Format**: `DC-38: [Brief description]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `DC-38: Fix failing unit test in CharacterTest`
  - `DC-38: Update test assertions for weapon state transitions`

```

## 🔄 CYCLE COMPLETION POLICY

### Critical Rule: Cycles Are Never "Complete" Until Explicitly Closed

**Individual Systems vs. Entire Cycle:**
- ✅ **Systems can be marked complete** when all their tasks are finished and tested
- ❌ **Cycles are NEVER complete** until explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **Cycles remain open** even when all currently planned systems are finished

### Why Cycles Stay Open:
1. **Iterative Discovery**: Implementation often reveals new issues or opportunities
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Additional systems may be identified during development
3. **Flexible Scope**: Cycles adapt to emerging needs and findings
4. **User Control**: Only the user decides when a cycle has accomplished enough

### Cycle Status Language:
- ✅ **"System N Complete"** - Individual system is finished
- ⭕ **"All Current Systems Complete"** - All planned systems finished, but cycle open
- 🚫 **NEVER say "Cycle Complete"** unless explicitly ordered to close out
- 🔄 **"Cycle Ready for Additional Systems"** - Appropriate status when systems done

### Git Branch Management Implications:
- **DO NOT merge development branch** until cycle closure is ordered
- **Commit individual system completions** but keep branch separate
- **Branch remains active** for potential additional systems
- **Merge only occurs** during explicit cycle closure process

### Documentation Status Implications:
- Mark individual systems as ✅ **COMPLETE** when finished
- Update cycle status to reflect current system completion
- Never mark overall cycle as complete in documentation
- Always leave room for additional systems to be added

---

## ⚠️ ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT REMINDERS ⚠️

### For Template Users:
1. **NEVER plan System 2+ while working on System 1**
2. **NEVER implement before planning is complete**
3. **NEVER add hints about future systems to placeholder sections**
4. **NEVER consider cycle complete until explicitly ordered to close**
5. **ALWAYS complete current system fully before considering next**
6. **ALWAYS test thoroughly before moving to next system**
7. **ALWAYS keep cycles open for potential additional systems**

### For System Planning:
- Plan only the current system in detail
- Leave future system sections as empty placeholders
- Add systems iteratively as they are identified
- Focus on one problem at a time

### For Implementation:
- Implement only planned systems
- Complete all testing before next system
- Update documentation as you go
- Mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing

*This iterative development cycle focuses on fixing test bugs and improving test reliability while maintaining flexibility for additional testing improvements discovered during implementation. Each system is completed fully before considering the next, ensuring focused development and thorough validation. The cycle remains open for additional systems until explicitly ordered to close, even when all currently planned systems are complete.*
