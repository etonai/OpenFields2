### Key Metrics
- **Total Java Files**: 119 (105 source + 14 test)
- **Test Coverage**: ~13% by file count
- **Resource Files**: ~50 (JSON, WAV, XML)
- **Active Development**: 6 commits ahead of origin/main

## Core Architecture

### 1. Game Loop Architecture
- **Framework**: JavaFX Application with Timeline-based game loop
- **Update Rate**: 60 FPS (60 ticks per second)
- **Timing System**: Tick-based with event scheduling via PriorityQueue
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based 2D graphics with zoom/pan support

### 2. Combat System

#### Ranged Combat
- **Hit Calculation**: Comprehensive probability system with 15+ modifiers
- **Key Factors**: Dexterity, stress, range, weapon accuracy, movement, aiming speed, wounds, skills
- **Projectile Physics**: Travel time based on weapon velocity and distance
- **Accuracy Penalties**:
  - Movement: -5 (walking) to -25 (running)
  - Aiming Speed: +15 (careful) to -20 (quick)
  - First Attack: -15 (new target engagement)
  - Burst/Auto: -20 (bullets 2+ in burst)

#### Melee Combat
- **Range Calculation**: Edge-to-edge distance with weapon reach
- **Damage System**: Base damage + strength modifier
- **Immediate Resolution**: No travel time for melee attacks

### 3. Weapon System

#### Weapon Hierarchy
```
Weapon (base class)
├── RangedWeapon
│   ├── Pistol type (holstered/drawing states)
│   ├── Rifle type (slung/unsling states)
│   └── Other type (magical/special items)
└── MeleeWeapon
    └── Reach-based weapons with skill associations
```

#### Firing Modes (Ranged)
- **Single Shot**: One bullet per trigger pull
- **Burst**: Fixed bullet count (e.g., 3 for UZI)
- **Full Auto**: Continuous firing until trigger release

### 4. Character System

#### Core Attributes
- **Physical**: Dexterity (1-100), Strength (1-100), Health
- **Mental**: Reflexes (1-100), Coolness (1-100)
- **Combat State**: Wounds, hesitation, bravery failures
- **Equipment**: Dual weapon system (ranged + melee)

#### Skill System
- **Combat Skills**: Pistol, Rifle, Submachine Gun (+5 accuracy/level)
- **Speed Skills**: Quickdraw (5% ready speed/level)
- **Future Skills**: Medicine (not implemented)

### 5. Event System
- **Architecture**: PriorityQueue<ScheduledEvent> sorted by tick
- **Event Types**: Combat actions, effects, highlights, hesitation
- **Owner System**: Events tied to entity IDs for cleanup on incapacitation

## Recent Development Progress

### Completed DevCycles (17-20)

## Technical Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Mature Combat System**: Realistic ballistics, comprehensive modifiers, dual weapon support
2. **Clean Architecture**: Logical package organization, separation of concerns
3. **Active Refactoring**: Continuous improvement (InputManager split, platform abstraction)
4. **Data-Driven Design**: JSON-based configuration for weapons, characters, factions
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed planning docs, analysis files, CLAUDE.md

### Technical Debt
1. **JavaFX Coupling**: Unit/Character classes still depend on JavaFX
2. **Limited Test Coverage**: Only 13% file coverage
3. **Large Classes**: Character class handles many responsibilities
4. **Incomplete Save System**: Event queue and some states not persisted
5. **Console Mode**: Partially functional due to entity dependencies

### Performance Considerations
- **Current Scale**: Designed for ~10 units
- **Future Target**: 40+ characters (Battle of Testing Fields)
- **Optimization Needs**: Event processing, rendering for large battles

## Future Development Path

### Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Cycles)
1. **Complete Platform Decoupling**
   - Create platform-independent Unit/Character classes
   - Enable full console mode functionality
   - Establish automated testing with console backend

2. **Scenario System Foundation**
   - Formation setup tools
   - Batch character creation
   - Victory condition framework

### Medium-Term Goals (3-5 Cycles)
1. **Campaign System Infrastructure**
   - Battle outcome tracking
   - Character progression/experience
   - Equipment management

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile with 40+ characters
   - Optimize rendering pipeline
   - Improve event queue efficiency

### Long-Term Vision
Transform from tactical simulator to character-driven campaign system with:
- Historical scenarios (Civil War battles)
- Character relationships and development
- Strategic layer connecting tactical battles

## Recommendations

### Architecture
1. **Entity Refactoring**: Create IUnit/ICharacter interfaces for platform independence
2. **Component System**: Consider ECS pattern for flexibility
3. **Event Bus**: Replace direct coupling with event-driven communication

### Quality
1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Target 50%+ for core systems
2. **Integration Tests**: Use console backend for automated testing
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baselines for optimization

### Development Process
1. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout of platform features
2. **Deprecation Strategy**: Plan migration path for JavaFX-coupled code
3. **Documentation**: Continue excellent practice of analysis documents

## Conclusion

OpenFields2 demonstrates professional software engineering with a sophisticated combat simulation, clean architecture, and active development. The recent platform abstraction work positions the project well for future growth. With 20 successful development cycles completed and clear vision for campaign gameplay, the project shows strong momentum and technical maturity.

The main challenges ahead involve completing the platform independence work and scaling to support larger battles. The foundation is solid, and the methodical development approach through documented cycles provides confidence in the project's continued success.
