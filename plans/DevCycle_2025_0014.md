*Created: 2025-06-20 at 12:28 PM PDT | Last Design Update: 2025-06-20 at 12:28 PM PDT | Last Implementation Update: [Pending] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This development cycle addresses critical functionality issues with character addition in Edit Mode and melee combat auto-targeting behavior. The CTRL-A character addition feature has regressed to an incorrect behavior pattern, and melee combat needs improvements for handling incapacitated targets and weapon readiness during movement.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Restore proper CTRL-A character addition workflow in Edit Mode
- Fix melee auto-targeting to handle incapacitated targets correctly
- Implement weapon readiness during melee movement to targets

**Prerequisites:** 
- Understanding of existing console input handling mechanisms
- Familiarity with current melee combat and targeting systems
- Knowledge of character generation and faction systems

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Involves UI workflow changes and combat behavior modifications with existing system integration

## System Implementations

### 1. CTRL-A Character Addition System ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Console-Based Character Addition Interface**
  - [ ] Remove intermediate character creation step from CTRL-A handler
  - [ ] Implement faction selection menu via console
  - [ ] Add character count input (1-20 maximum)
  - [ ] Integrate with existing faction data for current theme
  - [ ] Test single and multiple character addition workflows

- [ ] **Character Spacing and Lineup System**
  - [ ] Research and locate existing character spacing code
  - [ ] Implement configurable spacing input (measured in feet)
  - [ ] Use existing coordinate system for character positioning
  - [ ] Create character lineup algorithm with proper spacing
  - [ ] Test various spacing configurations

**Design Specifications:**
- **Console Interface**: Basic console menu list for faction selection, character count (1-20), and spacing input
- **Character Limit**: Maximum 20 characters per addition operation
- **Spacing Control**: Distance measured in feet (0.1-10 feet valid range), configurable per addition
- **Faction Integration**: All factions of current theme available for selection
- **Character Positioning**: Straight line formation from user-selected screen point, either right or down
- **Error Handling**: Console messages for invalid inputs
- **No Intermediate Steps**: Direct character addition without creation dialog

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: OpenFields2.java (CTRL-A key handler, character addition logic)
- **New Classes/Enums**: Potentially console menu utilities if not existing
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes expected
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing character data structures

### 2. Melee Combat Auto-Targeting System ⭕ **PENDING**
- [ ] **Target Status Monitoring**
  - [ ] Research existing target status checking methods
  - [ ] Implement continuous incapacitation status checking during movement
  - [ ] Apply to both manual and auto-targeting scenarios
  - [ ] Handle multiple attackers targeting same enemy
  - [ ] Test target status change responses

- [ ] **Weapon Readiness During Movement**
  - [ ] Identify current weapon state management during movement
  - [ ] Implement immediate weapon readiness when movement to target begins
  - [ ] Target "Ready" weapon state for melee weapons
  - [ ] Preserve existing weapon type differences
  - [ ] Test weapon readiness timing and states

**Design Specifications:**
- **Target Monitoring**: Every-tick status checking leveraging existing target location tracking
- **Multiple Attacker Handling**: All characters targeting incapacitated enemy should stop (no visual coordination)
- **Weapon Readiness Timing**: Begin immediately when movement starts
- **Weapon State Target**: "Ready" state for melee weapons during movement
- **State Persistence**: Weapon readiness persists if character stops before reaching target
- **Scope Application**: Both manual melee attacks and auto-targeting
- **Compatibility**: Use existing weapon type differences without modifications
- **AI Integration**: Existing AI logic takes priority over new functionality

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: OpenFields2.java (melee targeting logic, weapon state management)
- **New Classes/Enums**: None expected - use existing systems
- **Database/Save Changes**: No save format changes expected
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing weapon and combat behaviors

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Character Addition + Faction System**: CTRL-A addition must integrate with existing faction data and character generation
- **Melee Combat + Weapon System**: Target status checking must coordinate with existing weapon state management
- **Movement + Combat Systems**: Weapon readiness during movement must not interfere with existing movement mechanics
- **Console UI + Game State**: Synchronous console-based character addition must properly integrate with Edit Mode state

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **CTRL-A Character Addition**: Critical UI workflow fix (highest priority)
2. **Melee Target Status**: Important combat behavior fix (high priority)
3. **Weapon Readiness**: Combat efficiency improvement (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - CTRL-A key handler, character addition logic, melee targeting, weapon state management

**New Components Required:**
- **Console Menu Utilities**: If not existing, for faction selection and input handling
- **Target Status Checking**: Enhanced methods for every-tick target monitoring
- **Character Lineup Logic**: Straight-line positioning algorithm (may already exist in project)

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **CTRL-A Press** → **Console Menu** → **Faction Selection + Count + Spacing** → **Character Addition**
2. **Melee Attack Command** → **Target Status Check** → **Movement + Weapon Ready** → **Attack or Stop**
3. **Target Incapacitation** → **Status Broadcast** → **All Targeting Characters Stop**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - no new major data structures
- **CPU Usage**: Slight increase from every-tick target status checking
- **Rendering Impact**: No direct rendering changes
- **Save File Size**: No changes to save data (existing character state preservation maintained)
