## Design Specifications (Final)

Based on user review responses, the gunfight scenario specifications are:

### Gunfight Characters
- **GunfighterAlpha**: All stats 50, level 1 pistol skill, Careful aiming speed, Single shot mode
- **GunfighterBeta**: All stats 50, level 1 pistol skill, Quick aiming speed, Multiple shot count: 3
- **Health**: Both characters have 50 HP (reduced for faster combat resolution)
- **Distance**: 30 feet (210 pixels) apart
- **Auto-targeting**: Enabled for both characters

### Multiple Shot Configuration
- **Implementation Method**: Start scenario, select GunfighterBeta, press CTRL-1 twice to set multiple shot count to 3
- **Expected Display**: Console should show "*** [ID]:GunfighterBeta multiple shot count: 3 ***"
- **Behavior**: GunfighterBeta fires 3 shots in sequence per attack command with auto-targeting

### Test Success/Failure Criteria
- **Success**: Combat completes with one character incapacitated, no exceptions thrown
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  1. Any exception thrown during combat
  2. Combat duration exceeds 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **End State Output**: Display detailed stats for both gunfighters at completion

### Test Framework Approach
- **Monitoring**: Exception detection only, no detailed combat metrics tracking
- **Reporting**: Summary statistics at completion
- **Scope**: Focus solely on gunfight scenario perfection before additional scenarios

## Technical Implementation Questions

### Test Framework Design
**Question**: Should we create a base test class for common scenario automation, or keep each test class independent?

**Base Test Class Approach - Pros:**
- **Code Reuse**: Common methods for game startup, save loading, character monitoring
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all test scenarios
- **Maintenance**: Changes to core testing logic only need updates in one place
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new scenarios by extending base class
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling and logging

**Base Test Class Approach - Cons:**
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer may be harder to debug
- **Coupling**: Changes to base class could affect all derived test classes
- **Overhead**: Base class might include unused functionality for simple tests

**Independent Test Classes - Pros:**
- **Simplicity**: Each test is self-contained and easy to understand
- **Isolation**: Problems in one test don't affect others
- **Flexibility**: Each test can use exactly the approach it needs
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot issues in specific tests

**Independent Test Classes - Cons:**
- **Code Duplication**: Similar setup/teardown code repeated across tests
- **Maintenance Burden**: Updates to common patterns require changes in multiple files
- **Inconsistency**: Tests might use different patterns and approaches
- **Scaling Issues**: Adding many tests becomes cumbersome

**Recommendation**: Start with independent test classes for DevCycle 35 since we're focusing on perfecting one scenario. Consider base class approach in future cycles when we have multiple stable scenarios.

### Implementation Guidance
**EDNOTE**: The recommendation for independent test classes is approved. This approach will maintain simplicity while we perfect the gunfight scenario.

**EDNOTE**: Use BasicMissTestAutomated.java as the model for new test scenarios. This existing implementation provides proven patterns for:
- JavaFX threading and Platform.runLater() usage
- Game startup and debug mode activation  
- Save file loading and character verification
- Reflection-based access to private game fields
- Automated monitoring with atomic variables and CountDownLatch
- Exception handling and test completion detection

The gunfight test should follow the same architectural patterns while adapting for dual character monitoring and multiple shot mechanics.
