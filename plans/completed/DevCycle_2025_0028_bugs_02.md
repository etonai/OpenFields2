# DevCycle 2025_0028 - Bug Report #2

**Bug ID**: DC28-BUG-002  
**Date Reported**: June 28, 2025 at 2:20 PM  
**Reporter**: User Testing  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Priority**: High  

## Bug Description

**Issue**: CTRL-1 key conflict between multiple shot control (DevCycle 28) and individual character creation feature.

**Expected Behavior**: 
CTRL-1 should only trigger multiple shot count cycling for selected characters, as implemented in DevCycle 28.

**Actual Behavior**:
From user testing log:
```
*** Individual character creation only available in edit mode (Ctrl+E) ***
*** 1000:Alice multiple shot count: 2 ***
```

Both handlers were responding to CTRL-1, causing:
1. Individual character creation message to display
2. Multiple shot count to cycle correctly

This creates confusion and unintended dual functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem Location**: `EditModeManager.java`, lines 182-191

**Root Cause**: Pre-existing individual character creation feature was using CTRL-1 before DevCycle 28 implementation.

The EditModeManager's `handleEditModeKeys()` method contained:
```java
// Individual character creation (Ctrl+1)
if (e.getCode() == KeyCode.DIGIT1 && e.isControlDown()) {
    if (callbacks.isEditMode() && !stateTracker.isWaitingForAnyPrompt()) {
        startIndividualCharacterCreation();
    } else if (!callbacks.isEditMode()) {
        System.out.println("*** Individual character creation only available in edit mode (Ctrl+E) ***");
    } else if (stateTracker.isWaitingForAnyPrompt()) {
        System.out.println("*** Please complete current operation before creating characters ***");
    }
}
```

**Key Finding**: The user did not request individual character creation feature, and it conflicts with DevCycle 28's multiple shot control.

## Fix Implementation

**File**: `/src/main/java/EditModeManager.java`  
**Lines**: 182-191  
**Change Type**: Feature disable

**Solution**: Commented out the entire CTRL-1 handler for individual character creation.

**Before**:
```java
// Individual character creation (Ctrl+1)
if (e.getCode() == KeyCode.DIGIT1 && e.isControlDown()) {
    // ... handler logic
}
```

**After**:
```java
// Individual character creation (Ctrl+1) - DISABLED (DevCycle 28: CTRL-1 now used for multiple shot control)
// if (e.getCode() == KeyCode.DIGIT1 && e.isControlDown()) {
//     // ... commented out handler logic
// }
```

**Rationale**: 
- User confirmed they did not request individual character creation
- DevCycle 28 multiple shot control has higher priority
- Individual character creation functionality can be accessed through other means if needed

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: High - conflicts with core DevCycle 28 functionality  
**Scope**: All CTRL-1 key usage  
**User Experience**: 
- ✅ Eliminates confusing dual messages
- ✅ CTRL-1 now exclusively controls multiple shot count
- ✅ No functional loss (individual character creation not requested)

## Alternative Access

If individual character creation is needed in the future, alternative key combinations could be implemented:
- CTRL-SHIFT-1
- CTRL-ALT-1  
- Different key entirely

The functionality remains intact in the code, just disabled for CTRL-1 key binding.

## Testing Status

- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ CTRL-1 conflict resolved
- ⭕ Manual testing required to verify only multiple shot count message appears

## Related Issues

- **DevCycle 28 Implementation**: Multiple shot control system
- **Key Binding Management**: Need for centralized key binding documentation to prevent future conflicts

## Prevention

**Recommendation**: Create a centralized key binding registry to document all keyboard shortcuts and prevent future conflicts during development.
