*Created: 2025-06-29 at 16:05 | Last Design Update: 2025-06-29 at 16:05 | Last Implementation Update: [TBD] | Implementation Status: Planning*

## Overview
This is an iterative development cycle focused on continued Character.java size reduction and architectural improvements building on the foundation established in DevCycles 29-30. We will implement targeted improvements one task at a time to maintain stability while achieving meaningful progress.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Continue reducing Character.java line count using established manager architecture
- Implement one improvement at a time with testing between each change
- Maintain all existing functionality and backward compatibility
- Build upon DevCycle 30's manager foundation (CharacterSkillsManager, CharacterStatsManager, TargetManager)

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 30 successfully completed and merged to main
- Manager infrastructure established and functional
- Application compiling and running without critical bugs
- Character.java currently at 2,453 lines (target: continue reduction toward 2,000 lines)

**Estimated Complexity:** Low - Iterative approach with single-task implementation cycles

## Available Task Options

### Option 1: Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Target**: Extract ~60+ line method to CombatCoordinator following DevCycle 30 patterns

**Achieved Benefits:**
- Substantial line reduction (47 lines saved: 2,453 → 2,406 lines)
- Consistency with startAttackSequence extraction from DevCycle 30
- Low risk - well-defined method boundaries
- Follows established delegation patterns

**Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ Created `startMeleeAttackSequenceInternal()` method in CombatCoordinator with full 51-line logic
- ✅ Updated Character to delegate `scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState` calls to CombatCoordinator
- ✅ Made supporting methods public for CombatCoordinator access
- ✅ Maintained parameter compatibility and method signatures
- ✅ Tested melee combat functionality - application compiles and runs successfully

**Files Modified:**
- `CombatCoordinator.java`: Added startMeleeAttackSequenceInternal() method (53 lines added)
- `Character.java`: Converted scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState() to delegation (47 lines removed)
- Made `scheduleMeleeStateTransition()`, `scheduleMeleeAttack()`, `calculateAttackSpeedMultiplier()` public

### Option 2: Extract scheduleFiring Method ⭕ **AVAILABLE**
**Target**: Extract ~125 line method to CombatCoordinator following DevCycle 30 patterns

**Potential Benefits:**
- Massive line reduction (estimated 120+ lines) - largest single extraction possible
- Architectural consistency with DevCycle 30 combat method extractions
- Complex combat orchestration logic moved to appropriate coordinator
- Centralizes firing sequence management with other combat coordination

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `scheduleFiringInternal()` method in CombatCoordinator with full 125-line logic
- Update Character to delegate `scheduleFiring` calls to CombatCoordinator
- Handle character field access through parameters and delegation
- Maintain parameter compatibility and method signatures
- Test ranged combat functionality after extraction

**Method Analysis:**
- **Size**: 125 lines (lines 1714-1838) - largest method in Character.java
- **Complexity**: Very high - handles console output, weapon state transitions, ammunition management, audio/visual effects, projectile scheduling, burst fire integration, multiple shot sequences, recovery states, and reload triggering
- **Manager Integration**: Already uses BurstFireManager and AimingSystem - should be coordinated by CombatCoordinator
- **Usage**: Called from 2 locations in Character.java for firing sequence management
- **Risk**: Medium-High due to complexity, but follows proven DevCycle 30 extraction patterns

## Current Task Selection

**TASK 1 COMPLETED:** Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method successfully implemented.

**Available Tasks:**
1. ✅ **Extract scheduleMeleeAttackFromCurrentState Method** - COMPLETED (47 lines saved)
2. ⭕ **Extract scheduleFiring Method** - AVAILABLE (estimated 120+ lines)

**Next Steps:** Select Option 2 for next task implementation or close cycle based on user preference.

**Implementation Process:**
1. User selects one task from available options
2. Implement selected task completely with testing
3. Commit changes and verify functionality
4. Return to planning for next task selection
5. Repeat until satisfied with progress

## Iterative Implementation Methodology

### Single Task Focus
- **One Task Rule**: Only implement one complete task per iteration
- **Complete Testing**: Full testing and verification before next task
- **Risk Mitigation**: Conservative approach prevents compound issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear measurement of each improvement

### Task Selection Criteria
- **Impact vs. Risk**: Prefer high-impact, low-risk tasks
- **Architectural Consistency**: Follow DevCycle 29-30 patterns  
- **User Priority**: User selects based on immediate needs
- **Foundation Building**: Tasks that enable future improvements

### Quality Gates
- **Compilation**: Must compile without errors after each task
- **Functionality**: All existing features must work correctly
- **Testing**: Application must run and function properly
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for significant changes

## System Interaction Specifications
**Integration with existing DevCycle 30 architecture:**

- **Manager Infrastructure**: All tasks utilize existing CharacterSkillsManager, CharacterStatsManager, TargetManager
- **CombatCoordinator**: Method extractions follow established patterns from startAttackSequence extraction
- **Delegation Pattern**: Maintain backward compatibility through delegation
- **Parameter Passing**: Follow eventQueue and gameCallbacks patterns established in DevCycle 30

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`Character.java`** - Primary target for line reduction
- **`CombatCoordinator.java`** - For method extractions (Option 1)
- **Manager classes** - For delegation implementations (Options 2-4)

### Current State Foundation
**DevCycle 30 Infrastructure Available:**
- CharacterSkillsManager with singleton pattern and per-character HashMap storage
- CharacterStatsManager for health, stats, and wound management  
- TargetManager for targeting state management
- CombatCoordinator integration with all managers
- Established delegation patterns and parameter passing chains

### Progress Tracking
**Starting Point**: Character.java at 2,453 lines (192 lines saved from DevCycle 30)
**Target Direction**: Continue progress toward under-2,000 lines  
**Measurement**: Track line reduction after each task completion

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Method Dependencies**: Low - Iterative approach identifies issues early
- **Integration Complexity**: Low - Building on proven DevCycle 30 patterns
- **Compilation Issues**: Low - Testing after each task prevents compound errors

### Schedule Risks

- **Unknown Complexity**: Low - Most tasks are well-understood from DevCycle 30 experience

### Quality Risks
