# Iterative Bug Fixes and Improvements - DevCycle 2025_0016
*Created: June 22, 2025 | Last Update: June 22, 2025 | Implementation Status: Active*

## Overview

DevCycle 16 represents a shift from comprehensive upfront planning to an **iterative, incremental improvement process**. Instead of defining all systems and tasks in advance, this cycle will operate on a "one-issue-at-a-time" methodology where improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements are identified, planned, and implemented individually.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix bugs and issues as they are discovered during normal usage
- Implement small improvements and enhancements incrementally  
- Maintain rapid response capability for critical issues
- Keep the codebase stable and functional throughout the process
- Enable continuous improvement without large planning overhead

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15 InputManager refactoring completed successfully
- Clean, compiling codebase after major architectural changes
- Automation scripts (archive_cycle.sh, close_cycle.sh) available for cycle management

**Methodology:** **Iterative** - Items added and implemented one at a time as identified

## Iterative Implementation Queue

### Current Item: 8. Move Weapon State Timing to Individual Weapons ⭕ **PENDING**

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - User request to move weapon state timing from weaponTypes to individual weapons for per-weapon customization
**Implementation**: Modify Weapon class to store individual weapon state timings, update JSON files to include timing data per weapon
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Each weapon in ranged-weapons.json has its own weapon state timing data
- [ ] Weapon class stores and uses individual weapon state timings instead of weaponType timings
- [ ] ranged-weapon-types.json simplified to remove timing data
- [ ] All existing weapons use current weaponType timing values as initial individual values
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: 
- `/src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/ranged-weapons.json`
- `/src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/ranged-weapon-types.json`
- `/src/main/java/data/WeaponData.java`
- `/src/main/java/data/WeaponFactory.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Added individual `states` array to each weapon in ranged-weapons.json with timing from weaponTypes
- Modified WeaponData class to include states field for per-weapon timing data
- Updated WeaponFactory to use individual weapon states instead of weaponType states
- Simplified ranged-weapon-types.json to remove timing data (kept initialState only)
- Maintains backwards compatibility for weapons without individual states
**Evidence**: User request for per-weapon timing customization

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Timing fix works during initial combat but breaks after reload: (1) Pre-reload: consistent 65-tick cycles, (2) Post-reload: inconsistent timing returns (884→894 = 10 ticks, overlapping states again)
**Implementation**: Fix reload completion logic to maintain single event system consistency  
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Consistent timing both before AND after reload
- [ ] No return of dual event system after reload completion
- [ ] Proper event chain continuity through reload process
- [ ] Maintain 65-tick firing cycles post-reload
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Fixed reload completion logic to maintain single event system consistency
- Both `startReloadSequence()` and `continueReloading()` completion now skip checkContinuousAttack when persistentAttack=true
- Persistent attack mode maintains single event chain through entire combat cycle including reload
- Reload completion no longer restarts dual event system problem
**Evidence**: Perfect timing until reload, then 884→894 (10 ticks) and overlapping states return

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Previous fix didn't resolve core timing issues: (1) Still see overlapping states (aiming+recovering at tick 208, 273, 368), (2) Very fast firing (814→824 = 10 ticks), (3) Multiple continue attack messages persist
**Implementation**: Investigate weapon state timing calculations and fix fundamental timing arithmetic
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] No overlapping weapon states at same tick
- [ ] Consistent firing intervals matching weapon specifications
- [ ] Single continue attack message per cycle
- [ ] Proper state sequence: firing → recovering → aiming → firing (with correct tick spacing)
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Eliminated dual event system conflict by making persistent attack mode use ONLY continueStandardAttack scheduling
- Recovery completion no longer calls checkContinuousAttack when persistentAttack=true
- Single event chain: recovery → aiming → continueStandardAttack (30 tick delay) → next shot
- Verified weapon state timing: firing(5) + recovering(30) + firingDelay(30) = 65 tick cycle for Colt Peacemaker
**Evidence**: Chris still shows irregular firing: 814→824 (10 ticks), overlapping states at ticks 208, 273, 368

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Multiple firing rate inconsistencies: (1) Variable intervals between shots (30-65 ticks), (2) Overlapping weapon states, (3) Multiple "continues attacking" commands for same attack
**Implementation**: Fix weapon state timing, eliminate state overlaps, and ensure consistent firing delays
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Consistent firing intervals based on weapon specifications (Colt Peacemaker firingDelay=30)
- [ ] No overlapping weapon states (firing/aiming/recovering)
- [ ] Single "continues attacking" command per attack cycle
- [ ] Proper weapon state transitions without timing conflicts
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Added conflict prevention between recovery completion and continue attack scheduling
- Enhanced `scheduleAttackFromCurrentState()` to prevent scheduling during firing/recovering states
- Fixed race condition where both recovery and continue attack events triggered at same tick
- Added tick-based coordination to prevent overlapping weapon state transitions
**Evidence**: Chris shows inconsistent firing: tick 108→173 (65 ticks), 173→203 (30 ticks), 203→238 (35 ticks), plus overlapping states and duplicate commands

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Two issues: (1) Drake's Plasma Pistol reloaded too quickly (should take 60 ticks), (2) Auto-targeting continues scheduling attacks during reload sequence
**Implementation**: Fix reload speed calculation and prevent auto-targeting during reload state
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Reload timing matches weapon specifications (Plasma Pistol = 60 ticks)
- [ ] Auto-targeting respects reload state and doesn't schedule attacks during reload
- [ ] No firing attempts during reload sequence
- [ ] Clean reload completion before resuming combat
**Status**: Implemented  
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Added `isReloading` check to `updateAutomaticTargeting()` method to skip auto-targeting during reload
- Added `isReloading` check to `checkContinuousAttack()` method to prevent continuous attacks during reload  
- Verified Plasma Pistol reload timing is correctly configured at 60 ticks in weapon data
- Enhanced reload state awareness throughout auto-targeting system
**Evidence**: Drake started reload at tick ~572, completed at tick 638 (66 ticks, but should be 60), plus multiple fire attempts during reload

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Characters continue attempting to fire when weapon has no ammunition, causing repeated "tries to fire but out of ammunition" messages
**Implementation**: Add ammunition checks to auto-targeting and attack scheduling logic
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Characters stop attempting to fire when ammunition is depleted
- [ ] Auto-targeting triggers reload when out of ammo instead of continuing fire attempts
- [ ] No repeated "tries to fire but out of ammunition" messages
- [ ] Clean transition from empty weapon to reload sequence
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`
**Implementation Details**:
- Added ammunition checks to `continueStandardAttack()` method for both firing delay paths
- Enhanced logic to trigger reload when out of ammo instead of continuing fire attempts
- Added intelligent ammo/reload state checking before scheduling new attacks
- Prevents repeated "tries to fire but out of ammunition" messages
**Evidence**: Log shows Alice repeatedly trying to fire Uzi with 0 ammunition at ticks 682, 694, 700, 706

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Two issues: (1) Multiple "continues attacking" commands scheduling duplicate attacks, (2) Multiple reload sequences starting simultaneously
**Implementation**: Fix auto-targeting logic to prevent duplicate attack scheduling and add reload state tracking
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Characters issue only one "continues attacking" command per attack cycle
- [ ] No duplicate reload sequences when ammo is depleted
- [ ] Auto-targeting respects existing weapon states (firing, reloading, etc.)
- [ ] Clean transition from combat to reload to combat
**Status**: Implemented
**Files Modified**: `/src/main/java/combat/Character.java`

- Enhanced `continueStandardAttack()` with duplicate prevention check
- Enhanced `startReloadSequence()` and `continueReloading()` with reload state tracking
- Fixed auto-targeting logic to respect existing weapon states
**Evidence**: Log shows multiple "continues attacking" messages and duplicate reload starts at same tick

**Identified**: June 22, 2025 - Characters firing multiple bullets simultaneously during auto-target combat
**Implementation**: Investigate and fix event scheduling/weapon state transitions in auto-target system
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Characters fire exactly one bullet per intended shot
- [ ] No ammunition waste from simultaneous firing  
- [ ] Auto-targeting maintains proper weapon timing
- [ ] Weapon state transitions remain atomic
- [ ] No regression in auto-target functionality
**Status**: Implemented

- Added `lastFiringScheduledTick` field to prevent duplicate firing events
- Added duplicate attack prevention in `startAttackSequence()` method  
- Added duplicate firing prevention in `scheduleFiring()` method
- Fixed race condition in `handleBurstFiring()` by removing temporary `isAttacking = false`
