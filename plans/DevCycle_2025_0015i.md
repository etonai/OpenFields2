## Overview
DevCycle 15i completes the InputManager optimization strategy by achieving the original 800-1,000 line target through targeted extraction of remaining large components. This cycle focuses on extracting workflow state coordination, input validation services, diagnostic utilities, and consolidating similar method patterns to reach the optimal coordinator size.

**Development Cycle Goals:**

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15h must be complete (Phase 1-5 all components extracted)
- InputSystemIntegrator and InputUtils must be functional
- All existing input workflows must remain operational

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Focused extraction with well-defined boundaries and proven delegation patterns
