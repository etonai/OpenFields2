*Created: June 28, 2025 at 11:00 AM | Last Design Update: June 28, 2025 at 12:03 PM | Last Implementation Update: June 28, 2025 at 12:30 PM | Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED*

## Overview
DevCycle 28 introduces advanced tactical combat systems that provide players with sophisticated control over combat engagements. The cycle implements two major systems: Multiple Shot Control System allowing automated shot sequences with specific timing patterns, and Reaction Action System enabling automatic responses to opponent weapon state changes.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Implement flexible multiple shot control with automated aiming speed transitions
- Create reactive combat system for anticipatory tactical situations
- Integrate both systems seamlessly with existing combat mechanics

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 20: Burst fire system (for integration with multiple shots)
- DevCycle 25: Hold state system (for reaction hold mechanics)
- DevCycle 26: Firing preference system (for reaction shot preferences)
- DevCycle 27: Accumulated aiming bonus system (for reaction accuracy)

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium-High - Two interconnected combat systems requiring careful integration with multiple existing systems

## System Implementations

### 1. Multiple Shot Control System ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Core Shot Sequence Implementation**
  - [ ] Add `multipleShootCount` field to Character class (default: 1, range: 1-5)
  - [ ] Implement shot sequence tracking during combat
  - [ ] Create shot pattern logic (Aimed → Quick → Quick → Quick → Quick)
  - [ ] Handle ammunition depletion and reload interruption
  - [ ] Test with various weapon types and ammunition levels

- [ ] **Input Control System**
  - [ ] Implement CTRL-1 key handler for cycling shot count (ignore when in melee mode)
  - [ ] Support multiple character selection (all cycle to same value)
  - [ ] Multiple shot count persists internally when switching between ranged/melee modes
  - [ ] Persist shot count through target changes
  - [ ] Display current shot count in character stats
  - [ ] Test input handling with various selection scenarios

- [ ] **Combat Integration**
  - [ ] Modify attack scheduling to support multiple shots
  - [ ] Implement aiming speed override for follow-up shots
  - [ ] Handle accumulated aiming bonus reset for follow-up shots
  - [ ] Integrate with burst fire weapons (multiple trigger pulls)
  - [ ] Test combat flow with multiple shot sequences

**Design Specifications:**
- **Shot Pattern**: 1st shot: character's aiming speed, all subsequent shots: Quick
- **Inter-Shot Timing**: Uses Quick aiming mode delay between all shots
- **First Shot Penalty**: The existing -15 first shot penalty only applies to the first shot in sequence
- **Ammunition Handling**: Reload interrupts and ends multiple shot sequence
- **Weapon Restrictions**: Single-shot and melee weapons do not support multiple shots (CTRL-1 completely ignored in melee mode)
- **Burst Integration**: Multiple shots = multiple trigger pulls (can combine with burst weapons)
- **Save Integration**: `multipleShootCount` persists in save files (no backwards compatibility needed)
- **Interruption Handling**: Being hit or interrupted stops the multiple shot sequence
- **Auto-Targeting**: Auto-targeting respects multiple shot setting, firing at each auto-selected target

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `Character.java`, `OpenFields2.java` (input handling), save/load methods
- **New Properties**: `multipleShootCount` (int), `currentShotInSequence` (int)
- **Combat Flow**: Modify attack scheduling to queue multiple shots with appropriate timing
- **Console Output**: No changes to existing firing messages

### 2. Reaction Action System ⭕ **PLANNING**
- [ ] **Reaction Setup Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click handler (separate from CTRL-Right-Click)
  - [ ] Record target's initial weapon state as baseline
  - [ ] Move character to preferred hold state (based on firing preference)
  - [ ] Create reaction monitoring state tracking
  - [ ] Test reaction setup with various weapon states

- [ ] **State Monitoring System**
  - [ ] Implement per-tick weapon state monitoring
  - [ ] Detect any weapon state changes (including intermediate states)
  - [ ] Calculate reaction delay (30 ticks + Reflex modifier)
  - [ ] Support chain reactions with proper delay timing
  - [ ] Test monitoring performance and accuracy

- [ ] **Reaction Execution**
  - [ ] Trigger attack sequence after reaction delay
  - [ ] Queue reaction if character already attacking (execute based on original trigger)
  - [ ] Delay reaction until reload completes if reloading (execute based on original trigger)
  - [ ] Respect character's multiple shot setting during reaction
  - [ ] Apply accumulated aiming bonuses if earned
  - [ ] Use firing preference for reaction shots
  - [ ] Test reaction execution with various scenarios
  - [ ] Test reactions on incapacitated targets
  - [ ] Test reaction queuing during existing attacks

**Design Specifications:**
- **Control Input**: CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click (separate from existing CTRL-Right-Click hold)
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Every tick state change detection
- **Trigger Conditions**: Any weapon state change from initial state (including grippinginholster)
- **Reaction Delay**: 30 ticks base minus Reflex modifier (ranging from 50 to 10 ticks, higher Reflexes = faster)
- **Range Limitations**: None - reactions work at any distance
- **Target Restrictions**: One reaction target per character
- **Chain Reactions**: Supported with normal delay (30 + Reflex modifier) for each reaction in chain
- **Save Persistence**: Reaction state not saved (re-establish after load)
- **Visual Feedback**: No visual indicators for reaction mode
- **Cancellation**: Right-click on reacting character cancels reaction
- **Mutual Reactions**: Both characters trigger if set on each other (no infinite loop protection needed)
- **Simultaneous Reactions**: Multiple characters react simultaneously to same target
- **Incapacitated Targets**: Reactions remain set and will trigger even on incapacitated targets if weapon state changes

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Key Files to Modify**: `Character.java`, `OpenFields2.java` (input handling)
- **New Properties**: `reactionTarget` (Unit), `reactionBaselineState` (WeaponState)
- **State Tracking**: Monitor weapon state changes in game tick loop
- **Error Handling**: Allow setup on unarmed targets but never trigger (silent failure)

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Multiple Shot + Reaction System**: Character fires all shots in their multiple shot sequence when reaction triggers
- **Multiple Shot + Burst Fire**: Multiple shots act as multiple trigger pulls, each can be a burst
- **Reaction + Hold State**: Reaction overrides hold state settings (reactions cause attacks)
- **Reaction + Firing Preference**: Reaction shots respect character's firing preference setting
- **Reaction + Accumulated Bonuses**: Characters benefit from accumulated aiming bonuses when reacting
- **Multiple Shot + First Shot Penalty**: Only first shot in sequence has -15 penalty, follow-up shots exempt

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Multiple Shot System**: Higher priority - simpler implementation with clear mechanics
2. **Reaction System**: Lower priority - more complex monitoring and trigger system

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`combat/Character.java`** - Add multiple shot count, reaction tracking, shot sequence logic
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Add CTRL-1 and CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click handlers, modify combat flow
- **`CombatCalculator.java`** - Ensure first shot penalty only applies to first shot in sequence
- **Save/load methods** - Persist multipleShootCount property

**New Components Required:**
- **Shot Sequence State**: Track current shot number and sequence status
- **Reaction State**: Track reaction target and baseline weapon state
- **Input Handlers**: CTRL-1 cycling and CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click reaction setup

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **CTRL-1 Input** → **Character.multipleShootCount** → **Attack Sequence** → **Multiple Shots**
2. **CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click** → **Reaction Setup** → **State Monitoring** → **Delayed Attack**
3. **Weapon State Change** → **Reaction Detection** → **30-tick Delay** → **Multiple Shot Attack**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - two integer fields and one reference per character
- **CPU Usage**: Per-tick monitoring for active reactions only
- **Rendering Impact**: None - no visual changes
- **Save File Size**: Minimal increase (one integer per character)

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Multiple Shot System Questions
1. **Shot Sequence Interruption**: If a character is hit or otherwise interrupted during a multiple shot sequence, should the sequence stop, or continue if the character recovers?
- Stop the sequence

2. **Melee Weapon Behavior**: When you said "melee weapons do not support multiple shots," does this mean CTRL-1 has no effect when a melee weapon is active, or should it still cycle the setting for when the character switches to ranged?
- I don't understand the question. Can you provide an example?

**Claude's Response**: Example scenario: Alice has a sword equipped (melee mode active). When the player presses CTRL-1:
- Option A: Nothing happens - CTRL-1 is ignored while in melee mode
- Option B: The multiple shot count still cycles (1→2→3→4→5→1) and displays in stats, but has no effect until Alice switches to ranged mode
- I like Option B

Which behavior should be implemented?

**User's Decision**: Option B - Multiple shot count cycles and persists across weapon modes

**Final Clarification**: CTRL-1 is completely ignored in melee mode (no visual feedback or state change)

3. **Auto-Targeting Integration**: Should auto-targeting respect the multiple shot setting, firing multiple shots at each auto-selected target?
- Yes

### Reaction System Questions
4. **Mutual Reactions**: If Alice and Bob both have reactions set on each other, and one draws their weapon, how should the mutual reaction cascade be handled? Should there be any protection against infinite loops?
- The protection against infinite loops right now is to manually cancel a reaction. If Alice and Bob both have reactions set, and one draws their weapon, that will trigger the second to go into an attack sequence.

5. **Reaction Priority**: If multiple characters have reactions on the same target, should they all trigger simultaneously when the target changes state, or in some priority order?
- They all trigger simultaneously.

6. **Incapacitated Target Reactions**: If a character has a reaction set on a target who becomes incapacitated, should the reaction automatically cancel, or remain set but never trigger?
- Remain set but never trigger

### Technical Questions
7. **First Shot Penalty Confirmation**: The game has a -15 first shot penalty (found in GameConstants.FIRST_ATTACK_PENALTY). For multiple shots, should only the very first shot of the sequence have this penalty, correct?
- Yes

8. **Reflex Modifier Range**: For reaction delays, what should be the actual range of the Reflex modifier? The standard stat modifier range is -20 to +20, so should reaction delays range from 50 ticks (30+20) to 10 ticks (30-20)?
- Please do some research on this and get back to me. What is the reflex modifier on how quickly someone attacks with a weapon? I believe at least drawing speed is affected by reflexes.

**Claude's Research**: Based on the code analysis:
- **Reflexes Impact on Weapon Ready Speed**: Reflexes modifier (-20 to +20) is converted to a speed multiplier using the formula: `1.0 - (reflexesModifier * 0.015)`
- **Speed Range**: This gives a range from 1.3x slower (Reflexes 1) to 0.7x faster (Reflexes 100)
- **Weapon Readying**: Drawing, unsheathing, and unslinging are all affected by this multiplier
- **Aiming Speed**: 25% of the weapon ready speed bonus also applies to aiming transitions
- **Quickdraw Skill**: Additionally affects weapon ready speed (5% per level, multiplicative with Reflexes)

**Recommendation for Reaction Delays**: Using the same -20 to +20 modifier range directly on the 30-tick base would give reaction times from 10-50 ticks, which matches your suggestion. This is simpler and more intuitive than using the multiplier system.
Use your recommendation. Remember that a higher reflex modifier means they will react more quickly.

**User's Decision**: Use the recommended system - reaction delay = 30 - Reflex modifier (higher Reflexes = faster reaction)


### Implementation Priority Questions
9. **Partial Implementation**: If time constraints arise, which system is higher priority to implement first: Multiple Shot Control or Reaction Action?
- Multiple shot control has higher priority

10. **Feature Trimming**: Are there any aspects of either system that could be simplified or deferred to a future cycle if needed?
- Maybe. Please explain why this is a relevant question right now.

**Claude's Response**: I included this question as part of standard project planning practice to identify potential scope adjustments before implementation begins. This helps in two ways:
1. **Risk Management**: If unexpected complexity arises during implementation, having pre-identified simplifications allows quick decisions without breaking core functionality
2. **Time Estimation**: Understanding which features are "must-have" vs "nice-to-have" helps create more accurate time estimates

For DevCycle 28, potential simplifications could include:
- **Multiple Shot**: Could defer burst weapon integration complexity
- **Reaction System**: Could defer chain reactions or limit to single reactions initially

However, if you're confident in the full scope as designed, we can proceed with complete implementation of both systems.

Proceed with complete implementation of both systems.

**User's Decision**: Proceed with complete implementation of both systems.

## Additional Planning Questions

### Melee Weapon CTRL-1 Behavior
11. **Melee Mode Setting Persistence**: Following up on question 2 - when a character is in melee mode and the player presses CTRL-1, should the multiple shot setting still change (but have no effect until switching to ranged), or should CTRL-1 be completely ignored in melee mode?
- Ignore CTRL-1 in melee mode

**Final Decision**: CTRL-1 is completely ignored in melee mode


### Reaction System Edge Cases
12. **Dead Target Weapon State**: If a reaction is set on a target who is already incapacitated (dead), and that dead character's weapon state somehow changes (perhaps through external game mechanics), should the reaction trigger or not?
- The reaction will trigger

13. **Reaction During Reload**: If a character is reloading when their reaction triggers, should the reload be cancelled to execute the reaction, or should the reaction be delayed until after reload completes?
- Reaction is delayed until reload completes

### Combat Flow Integration
14. **Multiple Shot + Hold State**: If a character has multiple shots set to 3 and is using the hold state system (from DevCycle 25), do they fire all 3 shots when manually triggered from hold, or does hold state override to single shot?
- They fire all three shots

15. **Reaction + Existing Attack**: If a character is already in the middle of an attack sequence when their reaction triggers, what should happen? Queue the reaction for after current attack, cancel current attack, or ignore the reaction?
- Queue the reaction for after current attack

## Final Clarification Questions

### CTRL-1 Melee Mode Behavior Conflict
16. **Conflicting Answers Clarification**: You gave two different answers about CTRL-1 in melee mode:
   - Question 2: You chose Option B (multiple shot count cycles and persists)
   - Question 11: You said to ignore CTRL-1 in melee mode
   
   Which behavior should be implemented? Should CTRL-1 cycle the multiple shot count even in melee mode (for use when switching back to ranged), or should it be completely ignored?

Ignore CTRL-1 in melee mode

**Implementation Note**: CTRL-1 will have no effect whatsoever when a character is in melee mode - no cycling, no visual feedback

### Reaction System Final Details
17. **Reaction Delay Formula Confirmation**: To confirm the reaction delay calculation:
   - Base delay: 30 ticks
   - Formula: 30 - Reflex modifier
   - Example: Reflexes 90 (modifier +12) = 30 - 12 = 18 tick reaction delay
   - Example: Reflexes 20 (modifier -12) = 30 - (-12) = 42 tick reaction delay
   
   Is this calculation correct?
- Yes

**Confirmed Formula**: Reaction Delay = 30 - Reflex Modifier (clamped to minimum 1 tick)

18. **Queued Reaction Behavior**: When a reaction is queued (due to existing attack or reload), should the target's weapon state be re-evaluated when the reaction finally executes, or should it react based on the original trigger even if the target has changed states multiple times since?
- Please take whatever action you think is best.

**Claude's Recommendation**: React based on the original trigger. When a reaction is queued, it represents a commitment to respond to the initial provocation. Re-evaluating would make reactions unpredictable and could miss the intended tactical response. This approach:
- Maintains cause-and-effect clarity
- Prevents reaction "fizzling" due to rapid state changes
- Matches player expectations ("I set a reaction, it should fire")
- Simplifies implementation (no need to track state changes while queued)

## Implementation Ready

All planning questions have been answered and the design is complete. The plan includes:

1. **Multiple Shot Control System**:
   - CTRL-1 cycles shot count (1-5) for selected characters
   - Completely ignored in melee mode
   - Pattern: Aimed → Quick → Quick → Quick → Quick
   - Integrates with auto-targeting and hold states
   - Interrupted by hits, reloads, or target changes

2. **Reaction Action System**:
   - CTRL-SHIFT-Right-Click sets up reaction monitoring
   - 30-tick base delay minus Reflex modifier (10-50 tick range)
   - Triggers on any weapon state change
   - Queued reactions execute based on original trigger
   - Supports chain reactions and multiple simultaneous reactions

Both systems are ready for full implementation with all edge cases and integration points clarified.

- Auto-targeting system
- Hold state system
- Save/load persistence

### Bug Fixes

**Bug #1 - Rate of Fire Inconsistency** ✅
- **Issue**: 4th shot in multiple shot sequences had longer delay than expected
- **Root Cause**: Completely incorrect pattern logic - implemented complex `Aimed → Quick → Quick → Aimed → Quick` instead of simple `Aimed → Quick → Quick → Quick → Quick`
- **Fix**: Simplified pattern logic to: first shot uses character's aiming speed, all subsequent shots use Quick
- **Impact**: All multiple shot sequences now have consistent quick timing for shots 2+
- **Details**: See `DevCycle_2025_0028_bugs_01.md` for complete analysis

**Bug #2 - CTRL-1 Key Conflict** ✅
- **Issue**: CTRL-1 triggered both multiple shot control and individual character creation, causing dual messages
- **Root Cause**: Pre-existing individual character creation feature used CTRL-1 before DevCycle 28 implementation
- **Fix**: Disabled individual character creation CTRL-1 handler in EditModeManager.java (lines 182-191)
- **Impact**: CTRL-1 now exclusively controls multiple shot count, eliminates confusing dual functionality
- **Details**: See `DevCycle_2025_0028_bugs_02.md` for complete analysis

The implementation is complete and ready for manual testing and gameplay verification.
