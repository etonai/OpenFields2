## Overview
This development cycle begins the process of decoupling OpenFields2 from JavaFX to enable multiple rendering backends, improve testability, and support console-based operation. This foundational cycle focuses on creating the abstraction layer and implementing a minimal console backend as proof of concept.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Create platform abstraction layer for rendering, input, and audio
- Extract core game logic into platform-independent GameEngine
- Implement basic console renderer for testing and development
- Establish foundation for future platform implementations

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 17 completed (combat system enhancements)
- Understanding of current JavaFX dependencies (see javafx_decoupling_analysis.md)
- Maven build system functional

**Estimated Complexity:** High - Significant architectural changes required while maintaining backward compatibility

3. **JavaFX Adapter**: Maintain current functionality (high priority)
4. **Console Backend**: Proof of concept and testing (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Extract game logic to GameEngine, use platform abstraction
- **`MouseInputHandler.java`** - Generate InputCommands instead of direct manipulation
- **`KeyboardInputHandler.java`** - Generate InputCommands for key presses
- **`GameRenderer.java`** - Implement Renderer interface as adapter
- **`Unit.java`** - Remove render() method, move to renderer

**New Components Required:**
- **Platform Abstraction Layer**: Complete set of interfaces and factory
- **Core Game Engine**: Platform-independent game logic
- **Console Backend**: Full console implementation
- **JavaFX Adapters**: Wrapper implementations for existing code

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **User Input** → **Platform InputProvider** → **InputCommands** → **GameEngine**
2. **GameEngine** → **RenderCommands** → **Platform Renderer** → **Display**
3. **GameEngine** → **Sound Events** → **Platform AudioSystem** → **Audio Output**
4. **Platform Selection** → **PlatformFactory** → **Platform Instance** → **Game Initialization**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Additional abstraction layers add ~5-10MB overhead
- **CPU Usage**: Command queue processing adds minimal overhead (<1%)
- **Rendering Impact**: Render command buffer may improve performance through batching

*This development cycle lays the foundation for platform independence in OpenFields2. While ambitious in scope, the incremental approach and focus on maintaining backward compatibility ensures manageable risk. The console backend serves as both a proof of concept and a valuable tool for testing and development.*

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Scope and Priorities
1. **Console Backend Scope**: For the initial console implementation, what level of gameplay should be supported? Should we focus on basic unit movement and combat only, or include features like save/load, faction loading, and full game flow?
   - **Recommendation**: Focus on basic unit movement and combat only. This provides enough functionality to prove the abstraction works while keeping scope manageable. Save/load and faction loading can be added in a future cycle once the core abstraction is proven.

2. **Platform Priority**: Should we prioritize getting a minimal console backend working first to prove the concept, or ensure the JavaFX adapter is 100% compatible before moving to console implementation?
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure JavaFX adapter is 100% compatible first. This maintains a working game throughout development and allows A/B testing between old and new code paths. Console backend can then be developed without risk to the main game.

3. **Testing Strategy**: Should automated tests be created using the console backend immediately, or wait until the platform abstraction is stable?
   - **Recommendation**: Create basic automated tests immediately using a mock/test renderer. This helps validate the abstraction design early. Full console-based tests can be added once the console backend is functional.

### Technical Implementation
4. **Package Structure**: Should the platform abstraction code go in a new top-level `platform` package, or should it be placed under the existing package structure (e.g., `game.platform`)?
   - **Recommendation**: Create a new top-level `platform` package. This clearly separates platform-specific code from game logic and makes the architecture boundaries obvious. Use `platform.api` for interfaces and `platform.impl.javafx`, `platform.impl.console` for implementations.

5. **Color Handling**: The current game uses JavaFX Color extensively. Should we:
   - Create our own Color class that mirrors JavaFX Color API?
   - Use a simpler RGB representation?
   - Keep using JavaFX Color in the core and only convert at platform boundaries?
   - **Recommendation**: Create a simple RGBA Color class with just the needed functionality (not mirroring JavaFX completely). This removes the JavaFX dependency while keeping the API familiar. Include conversion utilities for easy migration.

6. **Input Command Granularity**: Should InputCommands be high-level (e.g., ATTACK_TARGET with unit and target IDs) or low-level (e.g., MOUSE_CLICK with coordinates that get interpreted)?
   - **Recommendation**: Use high-level semantic commands (ATTACK_TARGET, MOVE_UNIT, SELECT_UNIT). This makes console implementation easier and creates cleaner abstraction boundaries. The platform layer translates raw input to semantic commands.

7. **Render Command Design**: Should render commands be:
   - High-level semantic commands (e.g., DRAW_UNIT with unit data)?
   - Low-level drawing primitives (e.g., DRAW_CIRCLE, DRAW_TEXT)?
   - A mix of both?
   - **Recommendation**: Use high-level semantic commands primarily (DRAW_UNIT, DRAW_HEALTH_BAR) with a few low-level primitives for flexibility (DRAW_LINE, DRAW_TEXT). This balances abstraction with practicality.

### Console Specific
8. **Console UI Layout**: For the console display, should we:
   - Use the full terminal for the game map?
   - Reserve areas for status information, menus, etc.?
   - Support split-screen layouts?
   - **Recommendation**: Reserve areas for status information using a split layout: top 3 lines for game state/messages, bottom 2 lines for input/commands, middle area for game map. This provides consistent information display.

9. **Console Input Mode**: Should console input be:
   - Modal (select mode, move mode, attack mode)?
   - Command-based (type commands like "move 1 10 15")?
   - Hotkey-based (single keys for all actions)?
   - **Recommendation**: Use hotkey-based input with modal states. For example: number keys select units, 'm' enters move mode, 'a' enters attack mode, arrow keys or coordinates for targeting. This balances usability with implementation simplicity.

10. **Terminal Requirements**: Should we target:
    - Basic ASCII only (maximum compatibility)?
    - ANSI colors and Unicode (better visuals)?
    - Specific terminal emulators?
    - **Recommendation**: Target ANSI colors with ASCII characters (no Unicode). This works on most modern terminals while avoiding character encoding issues. Detect color support and gracefully degrade to monochrome if needed.

### Architecture Decisions
11. **GameEngine Responsibility**: Should GameEngine own:
    - All game objects directly?
    - Just references to existing game objects?
    - A completely new set of platform-independent game objects?
    - **Recommendation**: GameEngine should own references to existing game objects initially. This minimizes refactoring while establishing the abstraction. Future cycles can migrate to platform-independent game objects if needed.

12. **Event System**: The current ScheduledEvent system is already platform-independent. Should we:
    - Keep it as-is?
    - Wrap it in the GameEngine?
    - Create a new event system?
    - **Recommendation**: Keep the ScheduledEvent system as-is and have GameEngine use it directly. It's already platform-independent and works well. No need to add unnecessary abstraction layers.

13. **Save System Integration**: How should save/load work with multiple platforms:
    - Each platform implements its own save UI?
    - Unified save system with platform-specific file dialogs?
    - Console uses command-line paths?
    - **Recommendation**: GameEngine provides save/load methods that work with file paths. Each platform implements its own UI for selecting files (JavaFX uses file dialogs, console uses command input or command-line arguments). This maintains platform-appropriate UX.

### Migration Strategy
14. **Incremental Migration**: Should we:
    - Implement all four systems in parallel?
    - Complete platform abstraction first, then migrate?
    - Get console working with minimal abstraction, then refactor?
    - **Recommendation**: Complete platform abstraction and JavaFX adapter first, ensuring the game still works. Then implement console backend. This maintains a working game throughout development and proves the abstraction design early.

15. **Feature Flags**: Should we use feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations during development, or maintain separate code paths?
    - **Recommendation**: Use a single feature flag (`--use-new-engine`) to toggle between old and new implementations during development. Remove old code paths once new implementation is stable. This simplifies testing and migration.

### Performance and Optimization
16. **Render Batching**: The plan mentions render command batching. Should this be:
    - Implemented from the start?
    - Added as an optimization later?
    - Platform-specific optimization?
    - **Recommendation**: Add as an optimization later if needed. Start with simple immediate-mode rendering to keep initial implementation simple. Batching can be added transparently if performance becomes an issue.

17. **Memory Overhead**: Is the estimated 5-10MB overhead acceptable? Should we aim for lower?
    - **Recommendation**: 5-10MB overhead is acceptable for the abstraction layer. Modern systems have ample memory, and code clarity is more important than minor memory savings. Monitor actual usage and optimize only if it becomes a problem.

### Future Considerations
18. **Network Architecture**: Should the platform abstraction consider future network multiplayer needs now, or defer that design?
    - **Recommendation**: Defer network considerations to a future cycle. The current abstraction focusing on rendering/input/audio is already complex enough. Network architecture can be added as another abstraction layer later without disrupting this work.

19. **Additional Platforms**: Besides console and JavaFX, are there specific platforms we should design for (web, mobile, specific game engines)?
    - **Recommendation**: Design with LibGDX in mind as a likely next platform (cross-platform game framework). Keep the abstraction general enough to support it, but don't add specific features for it yet. Web and mobile can be considered after LibGDX proves the multi-platform design.

20. **Development Tools**: Should we plan for developer tools (replay viewer, state inspector) as part of this cycle or defer to a future cycle?
    - **Recommendation**: Defer developer tools to a future cycle. Focus on getting the core abstraction right first. However, design the GameEngine with state inspection in mind (e.g., getGameState() method) to make future tool development easier.
