## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Test Coverage Gaps

#### Unit Test Coverage
- **Missing**: Individual class unit tests for core game components
- **Limited**: Low-level component testing (weapons, characters, skills independently)
- **Needed**: Isolated testing of game mechanics without full game initialization

#### System Integration Coverage
- **Missing**: Save/load system comprehensive testing
- **Limited**: Input system validation beyond basic platform tests
- **Needed**: Data persistence and character creation system testing

#### Performance and Load Testing
- **Missing**: Performance benchmarks and load testing
- **Limited**: No stress testing of combat systems with many characters
- **Needed**: Memory usage and performance regression testing

### 2. Test Organization and Maintainability

#### Code Duplication
- Significant code duplication across test classes for game initialization
- Repeated reflection-based access to private fields
- Common test setup patterns not abstracted

#### Test Class Complexity
- Individual test classes are very large (500+ lines)
- Multiple concerns mixed within single test classes
- Lack of test utility classes for common operations

#### Dependency Management
- Heavy reliance on full game initialization for simple component tests
- Complex JavaFX threading requirements for most tests
- Difficult to isolate specific component failures

### 3. Test Execution and CI/CD

#### Automated Testing
- No continuous integration pipeline configuration
- Manual test execution workflow
- Limited automated regression testing

#### Test Categorization
- Tests not categorized by execution time or resource requirements
- Missing smoke tests for quick validation
- No progressive test execution strategy
