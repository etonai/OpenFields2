# Sound System Enhancements - DevCycle 2025_0025
*Created: 2025-06-26 10:53 PM PDT | Last Design Update: TBD | Last Implementation Update: TBD | Implementation Status: PLANNING*

## Overview
Iterative development cycle for enhancing the OpenFields2 sound system. This cycle will focus on expanding audio capabilities, improving sound management, and adding new audio features as tasks are defined.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- TBD (Goals will be established when tasks are added)

**Prerequisites:** 
- Current sound system functional (ranged, burst, melee combat sounds)
- AudioSystem interface and JavaFX implementation stable

**Estimated Complexity:** TBD - Will be determined based on assigned tasks

## System Implementations

### 1. Project Cleanup ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Uncommitted File Cleanup**
  - [x] Remove backup files (`Character.java.backup`)
  - [x] Revert test file changes that caused compilation errors
  - [x] Clean up git working directory
  - [x] Validate project compiles successfully

### 2. Ranged Weapon State Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add "pointedfromhip" State to All Ranged Weapons**
  - [x] Identify all theme-specific ranged-weapons.json files
  - [x] Add pointedfromhip state between ready and aiming states
  - [x] Update weapon state transitions for all ranged weapons
  - [x] Validate JSON structure and syntax
  - [x] Test weapon state progression with new intermediate state

**Implementation Results:**
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `ranged-weapon-types.json` (main weapon type definitions)
  - `themes/test_theme/ranged-weapons.json` (individual weapon state overrides)
  - `themes/civil_war/ranged-weapon-types.json` (theme-specific weapon types)
- **State Progression Updated**: `ready` → `pointedfromhip` (15-20 ticks) → `aiming` → `firing`
- **All Weapon Types**: PISTOL, RIFLE, OTHER weapon types now include intermediate state
- **Individual Weapons**: All 11 weapons in test_theme updated with new state progression
- **Compilation**: ✅ Successful - JSON syntax validated

### 3. Holstered Weapon State Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add "grippinginholster" State for Holstered Weapons**
  - [x] Update PISTOL weapon type state progression
  - [x] Add grippinginholster state between holstered and drawing states
  - [x] Update individual weapon definitions in test_theme
  - [x] Update civil_war theme weapon type definitions
  - [x] Validate JSON structure and syntax
  - [x] Test holstered weapon state progression with new intermediate state

**Implementation Results:**
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `ranged-weapon-types.json` (main PISTOL weapon type definition)
  - `themes/test_theme/ranged-weapons.json` (individual pistol weapon state overrides)
  - `themes/civil_war/ranged-weapon-types.json` (theme-specific PISTOL weapon type)
- **State Progression Updated**: `holstered` → `grippinginholster` (15 ticks) → `drawing` → `ready` → `pointedfromhip` → `aiming` → `firing`
- **Pistol Weapons**: All pistol-type weapons now include gripping preparation state
- **Timing**: Added 15-tick intermediate state for more realistic draw preparation
- **Compilation**: ✅ Successful - JSON syntax validated

### 4. Weapon State Hold System ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Implement Targeting with Weapon State Hold**
  - [x] Analyze current weapon state progression system and Weapon class states
  - [x] Implement dual targeting modes: Right-click (full attack) vs Ctrl+Right-click (hold)
  - [x] Create hold state cycling system using available weapon states
  - [x] Filter weapon states to exclude "firing" and post-firing states
  - [x] Add keyboard control to cycle through available hold states
  - [x] Implement hold state targeting that stops progression at selected state
  - [x] Test weapon state holding at different progression points
  - [x] Integrate with existing combat and targeting systems

**Design Specifications:**
- **Dual Targeting Modes**:
  - **Right-click on target**: Full attack sequence (current behavior)
  - **Ctrl+Right-click on target**: Hold at pre-selected weapon state
- **Hold State Selection**: 
  - **H key**: Cycles through current weapon's specific available states (single character only)
  - **Character Field**: Store current hold state preference in Character class (like movement speed/aiming speed)
  - **Available States**: Current weapon's states excluding "firing", "recovering", "reloading"
  - **State Examples**: holstered/slung/sheathed, grippinginholster, drawing/unsling, ready, pointedfromhip, aiming
- **State Management**:
  - **Default Hold State**: "aiming" (for new characters and weapon switches)
  - **Weapon Switch Behavior**: Hold state resets to "aiming" when character changes weapons
  - **Multiple Selection**: H key does nothing if multiple characters selected
- **Display Integration**: 
  - Show current hold state in complete character stats output (Shift+/ display)
- **State Progression Control**: 
  - Ctrl+Right-click: Character progresses to selected hold state and stops
  - Right-click: Full attack sequence (current behavior)
  - Manual trigger available to continue to firing if desired
- **Tactical Applications**: 
  - **Multiple threat levels**: From holstered warning to full aim
  - **Escalation control**: Player chooses level of weapon readiness
  - **Reaction positioning**: Pre-position weapons for quick response

**Implementation Results:**
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `combat/Character.java` - Added weapon hold state fields, cycling methods, and hold state progression
  - `KeyboardInputHandler.java` - Added H key handling for hold state cycling
  - `MouseInputHandler.java` - Added Ctrl+Right-click handling for hold state targeting
  - `DisplayCoordinator.java` - Added hold state display in character stats
- **New Features**:
  - **H Key Cycling**: Cycles through weapon-specific available states (single character only)
  - **Ctrl+Right-click Targeting**: Targets with current hold state instead of full attack
  - **Character Stats Display**: Shows current hold state in Shift+/ character stats
  - **Weapon Switch Reset**: Hold state resets to "aiming" when changing weapons or combat modes
  - **State Progression Control**: Weapon ready progression follows JSON-defined state transitions with proper timing, stopping at target hold state
- **Available Hold States**: All weapon states except "firing", "recovering", "reloading"
- **State Examples**: holstered/slung/sheathed, grippinginholster, drawing/unsling, ready, pointedfromhip, aiming
- **Timing Implementation**: Characters now properly spend time transitioning through intermediate states (e.g., holstered → grippinginholster → drawing → ready → pointedfromhip → aiming) with correct tick timing from JSON weapon definitions
- **Compilation**: ✅ Successful - All new functionality integrated without errors
