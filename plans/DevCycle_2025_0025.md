# Sound System Enhancements - DevCycle 2025_0025
*Created: 2025-06-26 10:53 PM PDT | Last Design Update: TBD | Last Implementation Update: TBD | Implementation Status: PLANNING*

## Overview
Iterative development cycle for enhancing the OpenFields2 sound system. This cycle will focus on expanding audio capabilities, improving sound management, and adding new audio features as tasks are defined.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- TBD (Goals will be established when tasks are added)

**Prerequisites:** 
- Current sound system functional (ranged, burst, melee combat sounds)
- AudioSystem interface and JavaFX implementation stable

**Estimated Complexity:** TBD - Will be determined based on assigned tasks

## System Implementations

*Systems and tasks will be added iteratively as development progresses*

## System Interaction Specifications
*Cross-system integration requirements will be defined when systems are identified*

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
*Files requiring modification will be identified when tasks are assigned*

### Data Flow
*Information flow between systems will be documented as tasks are implemented*

### Performance Considerations
*Performance impact will be assessed based on specific implementations*

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
*Test cases will be defined for each implemented system*

### System Integration Testing
*Integration tests will be specified when systems are identified*

### User Experience Testing
*UX testing approach will be defined based on implemented features*

### Technical Validation
- [ ] **Compilation and Build**
  - [ ] `mvn compile` passes without errors
  - [ ] `mvn test` passes all existing tests
  - [ ] No new warnings or deprecations introduced

## Implementation Timeline

*Timeline will be established when tasks and systems are defined*

## Quality Assurance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
*Risks will be identified and assessed as tasks are defined*

### Schedule Risks
*Schedule risks will be evaluated based on task complexity*

### Quality Risks
*Quality risks will be assessed for each implemented feature*

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All assigned tasks implemented and functional
- [ ] Integration testing passes without critical issues
- [ ] Performance impact is within acceptable limits

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Code compilation without errors or warnings
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] New features work as specified
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

### User Experience Requirements
*UX requirements will be defined based on implemented features*

git add [files]
git commit -m "DC-25: [Description]"

# Completion workflow
git checkout main
git merge DC-25
git tag DC-25-complete
git push origin main --tags
```

### Commit Message Format
- **Format**: `DC-25: [Brief description]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `DC-25: Add ambient sound system framework`
  - `DC-25: Implement dynamic volume control system`
  - `DC-25: Integrate environmental audio effects`

### Testing Commands
```bash
mvn compile          # Verify compilation
mvn test            # Run existing tests  
mvn javafx:run      # Manual testing
```
