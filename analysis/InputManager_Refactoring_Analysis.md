# InputManager Refactoring Analysis
Date Created: June 16, 2025 10:09 AM PDT

## Overview

The `InputManager.java` file has grown to 2,632 lines, making it the largest file in the codebase. This monolithic class handles all user input for the OpenFields2 game and has become difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This analysis provides a comprehensive refactoring strategy to break it into focused, manageable components.

## Current Structure Assessment

### File Statistics
- **Total Lines**: 2,632 lines
- **Primary Class**: InputManager
- **Dependencies**: 15+ external classes and managers
- **State Flags**: 13+ boolean flags for workflow state management
- **Major Methods**: 50+ methods with varying complexity

### Core Responsibilities

The current `InputManager` handles:

1. **Mouse Input Processing** - Click handling, drag operations, selection rectangles
2. **Keyboard Input Processing** - Key press/release events, modifier combinations
3. **Game State Management** - Save/load operations, victory conditions, scenarios
4. **Unit Command Processing** - Movement, aiming, combat commands
5. **Edit Mode Operations** - Character creation, weapon assignment, faction management
6. **Character Deployment** - Formation placement, weapon assignment during deployment
7. **Display Coordination** - Character stats, selection feedback, menu displays
8. **Workflow State Management** - Multi-step processes like character creation and deployment

### Key Problems Identified

#### **Single Responsibility Principle Violations**
- One class handling 8+ distinct areas of functionality
- Methods that combine input processing with business logic
- State management mixed with event handling

#### **Method Complexity Issues**
- `handlePromptInputs()`: 279 lines with deep nesting
- `handleKeyPressed()`: 90+ lines with multiple responsibilities
- `executeManualVictory()`: 90+ lines of complex victory processing

#### **State Management Problems**
- 13+ boolean flags for different workflow states
- Complex state transitions spread across multiple methods
- No centralized state validation or consistency checking

#### **Testing Challenges**
- Difficult to unit test individual functionality areas
- Heavy dependencies on external game objects
- State-dependent behavior hard to isolate
