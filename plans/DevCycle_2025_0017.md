- Integrate automatic skill-weapon bonus application
- Modernize terminology (projectileName → woundDescription)
- Add separated ranged/melee combat experience tracking

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 11: Critical combat math fixes (completed)
- DevCycle 16: UI improvements and weapon selection fixes (completed)
- Current weapon system functionality with JSON data loading

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Multiple interconnected systems with clean architectural improvements
