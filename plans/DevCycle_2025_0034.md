# Automated Testing Foundation - DevCycle 2025_0034
*Created: 2025-07-01 at 14:10 | Last Design Update: 2025-07-01 at 14:18 | Last Implementation Update: 2025-07-01 at 15:15 | Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE*

## Overview
DevCycle 34 establishes the foundation for automated testing in OpenFields2. This cycle creates test saves that can be used by the existing test system (mvn test) to validate game behavior. We implement test factions, test characters, test weapons, and a single test save that provides predictable, repeatable test conditions.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Create minimal test factions with deterministic characters
- Implement test weapons with extreme accuracy characteristics
- Create test saves using slots a-z (visible in debug mode via CTRL-D)
- Provide a single guaranteed-miss test save for existing test framework
- Establish foundation for future test save expansion

**Prerequisites:** 
- Existing faction loading system functional
- Character creation and stats system operational
- Weapon system and combat mechanics working
- JSON parsing capabilities available
- Analysis from DevCycle_2025_test_001.md
- See `/analysis/Test_Scenarios_After_33.md` for detailed research notes, design decisions, and system constraints discovered during initial planning.

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Requires careful integration with existing systems while maintaining deterministic behavior

## System Interaction Specifications
**Cross-system integration requirements and conflict resolution:**

- **Faction System + Test Infrastructure**: Test factions load through existing faction loader without modifications
- **Character System + Test Weapons**: Test weapons integrate with character inventory seamlessly
- **Combat System + Scenario Validation**: Combat results feed into validation system for outcome checking
- **Save System + Test Infrastructure**: Test saves use existing save/load with a-z slots
- **Debug Mode + Test Visibility**: Test slots only appear when debug mode is active

**System Integration Priorities:**
1. **Test Save Infrastructure**: Extend save system for test slots (highest priority)
2. **Test Factions/Characters**: Required for test execution (high priority)
3. **Test Weapons**: Enable predictable combat outcomes (high priority)
4. **Test Save Creation**: Provide saves for mvn test usage (medium priority)

## Technical Architecture

### Code Organization
**Files requiring modification:**
- **`OpenFields2.java`** - Add test scenario loading and execution methods
- **`factions/` directory** - Add TestFactionAlpha.json and TestFactionBeta.json

**New Components Required:**
- **Test Save Extensions**: Modify save system for a-z slots
- **Debug Mode Integration**: Show test slots when CTRL-D active
- **Test Save Files**: Create predictable game states for testing
- **TestWeapon Definitions**: Extreme accuracy weapons for testing

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **Test Save (test_a.json)** → **Save Loader** → **Game State**
2. **Test Code (mvn test)** → **Load Test Save** → **Execute Test**
3. **Game State** → **Test Assertions** → **Pass/Fail**
4. **Test Results** → **Existing Test Output Format**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - only loaded test scenarios in memory
- **CPU Usage**: Negligible - simple validation checks
- **Rendering Impact**: None - uses existing rendering
- **Save File Size**: No impact - test data separate from saves

### Files Modified
*Comprehensive list of all files changed during implementation*
- **`factions/TestFactionAlpha.json`**: NEW - Test faction with MissBot character (ID: -1001) having low stats and no skills
- **`factions/TestFactionBeta.json`**: NEW - Test faction with TargetDummy character (ID: -2001) having average stats  
- **`src/main/resources/data/themes/test_theme/ranged-weapons.json`**: Added 4 test weapons with extreme accuracy values (+100/-100) and damage 10
- **`saves/test_a.json`**: NEW - BasicMissTest save with MissBot and TargetDummy positioned 21 feet apart for guaranteed miss testing
- **`src/main/java/data/SaveGameManager.java`**: Added test slot support (a-z) with saveToTestSlot(), loadFromTestSlot(), and TestSaveSlotInfo class
- **`src/main/java/SaveGameController.java`**: Added loadGameFromTestSlot() method and debug mode test slot display in load menu
- **`src/main/java/NumberInputProcessor.java`**: Added test slot input handling for a-z keys in debug mode during load selection
- **`src/main/java/GameStateManager.java`**: Added handleTestSlotLoadInput() method for test slot processing
- **`src/main/java/input/interfaces/InputManagerCallbacks.java`**: Added loadGameFromTestSlot() interface method
- **`src/main/java/OpenFields2.java`**: Added loadGameFromTestSlot() callback delegation to SaveGameController
- **`src/main/java/KeyboardInputHandler.java`**: Added test slot key handling for a-z input with modifier key filtering and helper methods
- **`src/main/java/data/UniversalCharacterRegistry.java`**: Added auto-loading of test faction characters with loadTestFactionCharacters() and convertCharacterDataToCharacter() methods
- **`src/test/java/BasicMissTestSimple.java`**: NEW - Automated test that validates test infrastructure, loads test_a.json, verifies character setup, and confirms miss scenario configuration

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insights**: Input handling pipeline requires careful coordination between KeyboardInputHandler, NumberInputProcessor, and GameStateManager. JSON structure compatibility critical for character loading between faction files and registry classes.
- **Process Improvements**: Multiple debugging iterations needed for test save loading - validate JSON structure early and test input handling thoroughly before declaring complete.
- **Design Decisions**: Auto-loading test characters at registry startup ensures seamless integration without manual setup steps. Using negative character IDs prevents conflicts with regular game characters.

## Planning Questions for User Review

### Test Character Design
1. **Stat Ranges**: Are the proposed stat ranges (Dexterity 1-5 for MissBot) sufficient to guarantee misses, or should we use even more extreme values?
- Using the inaccurate test pistol will guarantee misses
2. **Skill Levels**: Should test characters have 0 skill levels or minimal (1) skill levels? What's the minimum skill value the system accepts?
- The MissBot should not have any skills
3. **Health Values**: Is 100 health appropriate for both test characters, or should TargetDummy have more health for extended testing?
- 100 health is fine.

### Test Weapon Specifications
1. **Accuracy Values**: Are +100 and -100 accuracy values within acceptable system limits, or could they cause unexpected behavior?
- Acceptable
2. **Damage Values**: What damage values would you prefer for test weapons? Lower values allow more test iterations.
- Set the damage to the test weapons to 10
3. **TestRifle Design**: Should TestRifle have special characteristics, or just be a standard rifle for variety?
- We should also have TestAccurateRifle and TestAccuratePistol

### Scenario Implementation
1. **File Organization**: Should test scenarios be in a separate `scenarios/test/` directory or mixed with future game scenarios?
- Please place them in the saves directory.
2. **Scenario Execution**: Should test scenarios be triggered via console command, special key combination, or menu option?
- They are loaded as save files
3. **Multiple Runs**: Should the BasicMissTest automatically run multiple times (e.g., 10 iterations) and report statistics?
- For now, just run once.

### Technical Integration
1. **Class Structure**: Should test-related classes be in a separate package/namespace or integrated into the main codebase?
- Integrated into the main codebase, with the existing tests
3. **Validation Output**: Where should test results be displayed - console only, log file, or special UI element?
- Console only
4. **Save System**: Should test scenarios have any interaction with the save/load system, or remain completely separate?

### Future Expansion
1. **Scenario Priority**: After BasicMissTest, what test scenarios would be most valuable? (guaranteed hit, burst fire, movement, etc.)
- Don't worry about that until after BasicMissTest is complete
2. **Automation Level**: How automated should the test system be in this cycle vs. future cycles?
- It should integrate wtih the existing test system
3. **Debug Integration**: Should test scenarios integrate with existing debug features or remain independent?
- integrate with existing debug features

### Scope Clarification
1. **JSON Complexity**: Should the scenario JSON format support more complex setups now, or keep it minimal for this cycle?
- Keep it minimal
2. **Error Handling**: How robust should error handling be for this first implementation?
- Keep it minimal
3. **Character Assignment**: Should MissBot always use TestInaccuratePistol, or should weapon assignment be part of the scenario definition?
- Weapon assignment is part of scenario definition

---

EDNOTE - For now, we don't have the concept of a difference between saves and scenarios. These are saves. Instead of using slot_1, call it slot_a through slot_z. They should be able to be loaded like any other save file, except that the test slots (a-z) are only visible in debug mode.

## Additional Planning Questions

### Save System Integration
1. **Save Format Extension**: Should test saves include a special "testMetadata" section to store expected outcomes, or should this be handled separately in the test framework?
- No special testmetadata
2. **Debug Mode Detection**: How does the system currently detect debug mode? Should we use the existing mechanism or create a new test-specific flag?
- Debug Mode is triggered in the game by pressing CTRL-D
4. **Save Slot Naming**: Should the save files be named `slot_a.json` through `slot_z.json`, or use a different naming convention like `test_a.json`?
- Use the test_a.json naming convention

### Test Execution Details
1. **Test Triggering**: After loading a test save (e.g., slot_a), should the test validation run automatically, or require a separate command/action?
- Tests are triggered as they are currently triggered. We are not designing a new test system. We are designing scenarios that will be easy for the existing test system to use for testing.
2. **Weapon Assignment in Saves**: Should the save format explicitly specify which weapon each character uses, or should this be part of the character's inventory data?
- Weapon assignment is in the save files.
3. **Test Completion**: After a test completes (e.g., MissBot shoots and misses), should the test automatically stop/pause, or continue normal gameplay?
- The test code will handle that.

### Technical Implementation
1. **Existing Test Framework**: Can you provide more details about the current test system structure that we should integrate with?
- mvn test
2. **Debug Mode UI**: How should test save slots be displayed in debug mode? As a separate section in the load menu, or mixed with regular saves?
- Mixed with regular saves
3. **Console Output Format**: What format would you prefer for test results? Simple pass/fail, or detailed information about the test execution?
- Use the existing test format
