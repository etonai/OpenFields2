## Overview
This development cycle addresses critical bugs discovered during testing of DevCycle 2025_0008 character management systems. These issues prevent proper character creation, deployment, and management functionality.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- Fix character naming system to use only firstName, lastName, and nickname
- Resolve character deployment failure when loading from faction files
- Restrict DEL key functionality to edit mode only

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 2025_0008 character management foundation
- Existing faction system and file persistence
- Current edit mode functionality

**Estimated Complexity:** Low-Medium - Clear bug fixes but may require data migration

## Bug Analysis and Solutions

### 1. Character Naming System Fix â­• **PENDING**

**Problem Analysis:**
- Characters currently have redundant name fields: nickname, name, firstName, lastName
- Naming confusion with multiple overlapping fields
- Nickname should typically match firstName for consistency

**Root Cause Investigation Needed:**
- [ ] Examine Character class name field definitions
- [ ] Check character creation workflow for name assignment
- [ ] Review serialization/deserialization of name fields
- [ ] Identify where redundant fields are populated

**Proposed Solution:**
- [ ] **Standardize Character Name Fields**
  - [ ] Keep only: firstName, lastName, nickname
  - [ ] Remove redundant 'name' field if it exists
  - [ ] Default nickname to firstName unless explicitly set
  - [ ] Update character creation to use simplified naming

- [ ] **Update Character Creation Workflow**
  - [ ] Modify character archetype creation to set proper name fields
  - [ ] Ensure nickname defaults to firstName
  - [ ] Remove any duplicate name assignments

- [ ] **Data Migration Strategy**
  - [ ] Update existing character files to use new naming scheme
  - [ ] Convert any 'name' field data to firstName/lastName appropriately
  - [ ] Preserve existing character data during migration

**Files to Investigate:**
- `src/main/java/combat/Character.java` - Character class definition
- `src/main/java/data/CharacterFactory.java` - Character creation logic
- `src/main/java/InputManager.java` - Character creation workflow
- `factions/*.json` - Existing character data files

### 2. Character Deployment Failure Fix â­• **PENDING**

**Problem Analysis:**
- Created 3 Confederate and 2 Union characters but deployment shows "No available characters"
- Characters are created but not properly saved or loaded from faction files
- Deployment system cannot find characters in faction files

**Root Cause Investigation Needed:**
- [ ] Verify character creation saves to correct faction files
- [ ] Check faction file format and character data structure
- [ ] Examine character loading logic in deployment workflow
- [ ] Test character creation and file persistence step-by-step

**Proposed Solution:**
- [ ] **Character Persistence Debug**
  - [ ] Verify characters are saved to faction files during creation
  - [ ] Check faction file JSON structure matches expected format
  - [ ] Ensure character data includes all required fields
  - [ ] Validate file write permissions and directory structure

- [ ] **Character Loading Debug**
  - [ ] Test faction file reading in deployment workflow
  - [ ] Verify character filtering logic (non-incapacitated)
  - [ ] Check faction ID matching between files and deployment
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for missing/corrupt files

- [ ] **Deployment Workflow Validation**
  - [ ] Test end-to-end: create characters â†’ save â†’ deploy
  - [ ] Add debug logging to character loading process
  - [ ] Verify faction selection matches available factions
  - [ ] Check character availability filtering logic

**Debug Steps:**
1. **Verify Character Creation**: Create character and immediately check faction file
2. **Test File Persistence**: Confirm faction files contain character data
3. **Debug Character Loading**: Add logging to deployment character loading
4. **Validate Faction Matching**: Ensure faction IDs match between creation and deployment

### 3. DEL Command Edit Mode Restriction â­• **PENDING**

**Problem Analysis:**
- DEL key currently works in both normal and edit modes
- Should be restricted to edit mode only for safety
- Players might accidentally delete units during normal gameplay

**Root Cause Investigation Needed:**
- [ ] Check InputManager DEL key handler conditions
- [ ] Verify edit mode state checking
- [ ] Review when DEL functionality should be available

**Proposed Solution:**
- [ ] **Add Edit Mode Check**
  - [ ] Modify DEL key handler to check edit mode state
  - [ ] Show informative message if used in normal mode
  - [ ] Ensure edit mode state is properly tracked

- [ ] **Update User Documentation**
  - [ ] Update COMMANDS.md to specify DEL works only in edit mode
  - [ ] Add clear messaging about edit mode requirement
  - [ ] Document proper workflow for unit deletion

**Implementation:**
```java
// In InputManager.java DEL key handler
if (!editMode) {
    System.out.println("*** Unit deletion is only available in edit mode ***");
    System.out.println("*** Press CTRL+E to enter edit mode ***");
    return;
}
```

## Files to Modify

### Core Implementation Files
- **`src/main/java/combat/Character.java`** - Character name field standardization
- **`src/main/java/data/CharacterFactory.java`** - Character creation logic fixes
- **`src/main/java/InputManager.java`** - DEL command edit mode restriction
- **`src/main/java/data/CharacterPersistenceManager.java`** - Character loading fixes

### Data Migration Files
- **`factions/*.json`** - Update existing character data to new naming format

### Documentation Files
- **`COMMANDS.md`** - Update DEL command documentation
- **`README.md`** - Update character management workflow if needed

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data Migration**: Risk of corrupting existing character files during naming format conversion
- **Character Loading**: Complex debugging may reveal deeper persistence issues
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Changes might affect save/load of existing scenarios

### Schedule Risks
- **Root Cause Complexity**: Character deployment bug might be more complex than anticipated
- **Data Migration Time**: Converting existing character files might take longer than expected

### Quality Risks
- **Character Data Loss**: Improper migration could lose character progress
- **Workflow Regression**: Fixes might break other character management features
- **User Confusion**: Changes to naming or deletion behavior might confuse existing users

## Mitigation Strategies

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Backup Strategy**: Create backup of factions/ directory before making changes
- [ ] **Incremental Testing**: Test fixes on individual faction files before mass migration
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to restore original character data

### Development Approach
- [ ] **Isolated Testing**: Test each fix separately before integration
- [ ] **Progressive Implementation**: Fix issues in order of complexity
- [ ] **Validation at Each Step**: Verify each fix works before moving to next

### User Communication
- [ ] **Clear Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation with changes
- [ ] **Migration Guidance**: Provide instructions if users need to migrate data manually
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Ensure all error conditions provide helpful guidance
