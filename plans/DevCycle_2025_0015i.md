## Overview
DevCycle 15i completes the InputManager optimization strategy by achieving the original 800-1,000 line target through targeted extraction of remaining large components. This cycle focuses on extracting workflow state coordination, input validation services, diagnostic utilities, and consolidating similar method patterns to reach the optimal coordinator size.

**Development Cycle Goals:**
- **Achieve 800-1,000 line target** for InputManager.java (currently 2,534 lines)
- **Extract workflow state management** into dedicated coordinator (~300 lines)
- **Centralize input validation** in specialized service (~200 lines)
- **Extract diagnostic utilities** for better separation of concerns (~150 lines)
- **Consolidate method patterns** to reduce code duplication (~200 lines)

**Prerequisites:** 
- DevCycle 15h must be complete (Phase 1-5 all components extracted)
- InputSystemIntegrator and InputUtils must be functional
- All existing input workflows must remain operational

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Focused extraction with well-defined boundaries and proven delegation patterns
