- Fix melee auto-targeting to handle incapacitated targets correctly
- Implement weapon readiness during melee movement to targets

**Prerequisites:** 
- Understanding of existing console input handling mechanisms
- Familiarity with current melee combat and targeting systems
- Knowledge of character generation and faction systems

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - Involves UI workflow changes and combat behavior modifications with existing system integration

### Data Flow
**Information flow between systems:**
1. **CTRL-A Press** → **Console Menu** → **Faction Selection + Count + Spacing** → **Character Addition**
2. **Melee Attack Command** → **Target Status Check** → **Movement + Weapon Ready** → **Attack or Stop**
3. **Target Incapacitation** → **Status Broadcast** → **All Targeting Characters Stop**

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - no new major data structures
- **CPU Usage**: Slight increase from every-tick target status checking
- **Rendering Impact**: No direct rendering changes
- **Save File Size**: No changes to save data (existing character state preservation maintained)

**Systems Completed**:
- **✅ CTRL-A Character Addition**: Completely reimplemented CTRL-A to use direct faction selection workflow with configurable character count (1-20) and spacing (1-9 feet). Creates characters in horizontal lines with proper pixel spacing conversion.
- **✅ Melee Combat Auto-Targeting**: Enhanced existing target status checking (already implemented) and added automatic weapon readiness during movement to targets. Characters now ready melee weapons immediately when starting movement toward targets.

### Key Achievements
- Successfully restored CTRL-A direct character addition workflow without intermediate character creation steps
- Seamlessly integrated with existing faction system and console input handling patterns
- Enhanced melee combat responsiveness by adding automatic weapon readiness during movement
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing systems and interfaces
- Achieved efficient character spacing system using existing coordinate conversion (7 pixels = 1 foot)

### Files Modified
*Comprehensive list of all files changed during implementation*
- **`InputManager.java`**: Added new direct character addition workflow with state management, input handling, mouse click placement, character generation, and weapon readiness integration. Modified CTRL-A handler, added new enum DirectAdditionStep, new state variables, and three new methods (promptForDirectCharacterAddition, handleDirectCharacterAdditionInput, cancelDirectCharacterAddition, handleCharacterPlacement, generateRandomCharacterForFaction).

### Lessons Learned
- **Technical Insights**: The existing codebase had comprehensive deployment and batch creation systems that provided excellent patterns to follow. Target incapacitation checking was already implemented in Character.updateMeleeMovement(), requiring no additional work.
- **Process Improvements**: Research phase was crucial - understanding existing systems first prevented duplication and ensured consistent integration patterns.
- **Design Decisions**: Chose to reuse existing faction numbering (1-3) and getFactionColor() method rather than creating new systems. Used existing Unit constructor pattern and weapon assignment approach for consistency.

### Future Enhancements
- Could add formation options (vertical line, circle, square) beyond horizontal line
- Could integrate with theme-based character generation for more variety
- Could add character archetype selection option to direct addition workflow
