# DevCycle_2025_0034_brainstorm.md

## Overview

DevCycle 34 focuses on creating the foundation for automated testing in OpenFields2. This cycle will establish the basic infrastructure needed for predictable, repeatable test scenarios by implementing test factions, test characters, test weapons, and a single test scenario. This builds on the analysis and planning from DevCycle_2025_test_001.md.

## Core Objectives

1. **Create two test factions** - minimal faction definitions specifically for testing
2. **Create one test character per faction** - deterministic characters with known behaviors
3. **Create test weapons** - weapons with predictable characteristics for reliable testing
4. **Implement a single test scenario** - foundation scenario that can be executed and validated
5. **Establish test data structure** - format and loading mechanism for test scenarios

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Test Factions

**Test Faction Alpha**
- Faction file: `factions/TestFactionAlpha.json`
- Single character with guaranteed miss characteristics
- Minimal stats for predictable failure outcomes
- Simple naming convention for easy identification

**Test Faction Beta** 
- Faction file: `factions/TestFactionBeta.json`
- Single character as target/defender
- Standard stats to serve as baseline target
- Complementary to Alpha faction for testing interactions

### Test Characters

**Alpha Test Character: "MissBot"**
- Extremely low dexterity (1-5 range)
- Minimal weapon skills (0-1 levels)
- Low reflexes for slow weapon handling
- Standard health for survivability during testing
- Designed to consistently miss targets

**Beta Test Character: "TargetDummy"**
- Average stats across all categories
- Baseline character for receiving attacks
- Sufficient health for multiple test iterations
- Standard weapon skills for comparison

### Test Weapons

**Test Pistol: "TestAccuratePistol"**
- Standard pistol mechanics
- Low damage value
- Unreasonably high accuracy value 100
- Adequate ammunition for test scenarios
- Well-defined state transitions
- Otherwise based on Colt Peacemaker

**Test Pistol: "TestInaccuratePistol"**
- Standard pistol mechanics
- Predictable damage value
- Unreasonably low accuracy value -100
- Adequate ammunition for test scenarios
- Well-defined state transitions
- Otherwise based on Colt Peacemaker
- 
**Test Rifle: "TestRifle"**
- Standard rifle mechanics
- Longer range for distance testing
- Predictable characteristics
- Different weapon type for variety

### Single Test Scenario

**Scenario: "BasicMissTest"**
- MissBot (Alpha) attempts to shoot TargetDummy (Beta)
- MissBot assigned TestInaccuratePistol
- Fixed positioning of 21 feet
- Single shot attack sequence
- Expected outcome: consistent miss
- Validation criteria: no damage dealt to target

### Test Data Structure

**Scenario Format**
```json
{
  "scenarioName": "BasicMissTest",
  "description": "Basic guaranteed miss test scenario",
  "characters": [
    {
      "faction": "TestFactionAlpha",
      "characterId": "MissBot",
      "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200},
      "facing": 90
    },
    {
      "faction": "TestFactionBeta", 
      "characterId": "TargetDummy",
      "position": {"x": 300, "y": 200},
      "facing": 270
    }
  ],
  "expectedOutcome": {
    "type": "miss",
    "attacker": "MissBot",
    "target": "TargetDummy",
    "description": "MissBot should consistently miss TargetDummy"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Test Factions and Characters
1. Create TestFactionAlpha.json with MissBot character
2. Create TestFactionBeta.json with TargetDummy character
3. Design character stats for guaranteed miss behavior
4. Test faction loading and character creation
5. Validate character behaviors match expectations

### Phase 2: Test Weapons
1. Define TestAccuratePistol weapon characteristics
1. Define TestInaccuratePistol weapon characteristics
2. Define TestRifle weapon characteristics
3. Integrate weapons into test characters
4. Validate weapon behaviors are predictable
5. Document weapon specifications for future tests

### Phase 3: Test Scenario Infrastructure
1. Design scenario data structure and format
2. Implement basic scenario loading mechanism
3. Create scenario parser for JSON format
4. Add scenario execution framework
5. Implement basic validation system

### Phase 4: Single Test Scenario
1. Create BasicMissTest scenario definition
2. Implement scenario positioning logic
3. Add scenario execution workflow
4. Create validation checks for expected outcomes
5. Test scenario repeatedly for consistency

### Phase 5: Integration and Validation
1. Integrate all components into cohesive test system
2. Run BasicMissTest multiple times for validation
3. Document test execution process
4. Create foundation for future test scenarios
5. Prepare system for expansion in future cycles

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product
- Two test factions can be loaded successfully
- Test characters have predictable, deterministic behaviors
- Single test scenario executes without errors
- Expected outcome (guaranteed miss) occurs consistently
- Foundation exists for adding more test scenarios

### Validation Requirements
- MissBot consistently misses TargetDummy (90%+ miss rate)
- Scenario can be loaded and executed repeatedly
- No crashes or errors during test execution
- Clear documentation of test character specifications
- Reusable framework for future test development

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing faction loading system
- Use current character creation mechanisms
- Build on existing weapon system
- Integrate with save/load infrastructure where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with existing game systems

### Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Start with minimal working implementation
- **Predictability**: Focus on deterministic, repeatable outcomes
- **Modularity**: Design for easy expansion and modification
- **Documentation**: Clear specifications for all test components
- **Non-Intrusive**: Test system should not impact core game functionality

### Future Expansion
- Framework should support additional test scenarios
- Character generation should be reusable for other test types
- Scenario format should be extensible
- Validation system should support different outcome types
- Integration points prepared for automated test execution

## Dependencies

- Existing faction system (factions/*.json loading)
- Current character creation and stats system
- Weapon system and combat mechanics
- Basic game loop and event scheduling
- File I/O and JSON parsing capabilities

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Skill system limits**: Research actual stat ranges before character design
- **Combat system complexity**: Keep scenarios simple to avoid unpredictable interactions
- **JSON parsing**: Use existing faction file format as template

### Scope Risks
- **Feature creep**: Focus strictly on single scenario foundation
- **Perfect determinism**: Accept very high reliability instead of absolute guarantees
- **Complex automation**: Keep automation minimal for this cycle

## Notes

- This cycle builds directly on research from DevCycle_2025_test_001.md
- Focus is on foundation rather than comprehensive test coverage
- Future cycles will expand test scenario library and automation
- Success measured by consistency and repeatability of single test case
- Framework designed to support future expansion without major refactoring

EDNOTE: The goal is to get the basic infrastructure working with one solid, repeatable test case. More elaborate testing scenarios and automation can be added in subsequent cycles once we have the foundation proven and working.
